Actions
=======

Actions are the individual capabilities of connectors, allowing users to
create automation that interacts with external technologies. Data passes
into an action as an input, processes, and then the action results are
available from the action as outputs.

Security is key! Turbine elevates data security by only allowing signed
and validated Swimlane-produced connectors.
