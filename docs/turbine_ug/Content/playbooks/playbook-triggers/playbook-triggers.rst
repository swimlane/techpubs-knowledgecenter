Playbook Triggers
=================

A trigger initiates playbook processes. A playbook can have more than
one trigger or trigger type. Turbine currently uses several types of
triggers to retrieve and/or ingest data.

This section covers features including:

-  Webhooks

-  Record Events

-  Schedules

-  Record Action Triggers

-  Calling from Another Playbook

**Note:** You may need an expression (dot notation) depending on the
trigger type to configure and/or map data to a playbook.

**Note:** You do not need to select a trigger before adding and
configuring actions and conditions.

**Tip:** See `Context Variables <../context-variables.htm>`__ for
helpful expressions when creating playbook triggers to help define
parameters and retrieve/store specific data.
