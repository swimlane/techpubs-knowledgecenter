Create Playbooks
================

**Important!** The system defaults to time out at one hour for a
playbook, and 15 minutes for a connector action. Keep this in mind when
creating playbooks to execute and run.

**Also Important!** Playbook action input and outputs are limited to
20MiB. You should always narrow data down as much as possible for
playbook and action performance. For more information about
file-handling limits, click `Playbook File
Handling <playbook-file-handling.rst>`__.
