=============================

Click the icon to open a new chat. The first time you ask a question,
the chatbot will ensure that you acknowledge that your organization has
accepted the Swimlane Terms and Conditions. Click **Swimlane Terms and
Conditions** to review them. Next, select **Acknowledge**, and then
click the Send icon.

Now you can begin asking questions!

The Swimlane Hero AI Help Chatbot is loaded with Turbine technical
content - both the `Turbine User
Guide <../welcome-to-the-turbine-user-guide.rst>`__ and the `Turbine
Platform Installer
Guide <https://docs.swimlane.com/turbine_installer/>`__. The chatbot
answers each of your questions individually. Also, be sure not to enter
any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or confidential information
in your questions.

The chatbot will answer your questions, when possible, with links to
relevant topics in the Turbine content. You can see up to 5 links so
that you can select the topic most suited to answer your question.
Clicking a link opens a new tab in your browser that loads the content.
If the chatbot cannot find an answer to your question, it will respond,
"I don't know."
