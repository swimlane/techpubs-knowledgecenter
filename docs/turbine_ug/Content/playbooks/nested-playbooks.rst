**Note:** When nesting a playbook into a parent playbook, the nested
playbook's inputs and outputs are available to map to and use in the
parent playbook.

To nest a playbook to a new/current playbook:

#. Navigate to the **Playbooks** home page, and then open a playbook (or
   create/upload a playbook).

#. Click **Add an action**.

#. From ACTION, click the **Action** drop-down menu, and select an
   existing playbook.

4. From ACTION, add a title.

5. Click **Configure** to map inputs and outputs.

If the nested playbook has inputs and/or outputs, they are available on
Action Inputs.

6. When finished, click **Apply**.

You have successfully nested a playbook to your current playbook.

View Parent Playbooks as Triggers in Nested Playbooks
-----------------------------------------------------

**Note:** You do not need to select a trigger before adding and
configuring actions and conditions.

A trigger automates actions based on the criteria set within a playbook.
Playbooks can also be triggers. There are parent and nested playbooks.

When an action is configured to call a nested playbook, the nested
playbook will show that parent playbook as a trigger.

**Tip:** If you have more than one playbook as a trigger, click the
desired playbook trigger, which will be visible with a blue highlight
box around the trigger.
