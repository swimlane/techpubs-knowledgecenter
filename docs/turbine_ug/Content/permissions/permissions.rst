Permissions
===========

Swimlane Turbine uses a role-based permissions model. We designed
permissions with flexibility in mind which allows for a flexible
administration of roles, groups, users and their permissions. This also
allows for synchronization between Turbine and customer systems like
LDAP and Active Directory.

Administrators can set permissions for:

-  **Roles:** Functional roles associated with users and groups that
   hold permissions to objects.
-  **Users:** Users defined in Turbine or imported to Turbine from
   Active Directory.
-  **Groups:** Collections of users and other groups.
-  **Turbine Objects:** Secured features of Turbine, such as records,
   applications, applets, records, reports, workspaces, and dashboards.

Additionally for Turbine objects, you set the level of access for users,
roles, and groups such as:

-  **Create**
-  **Read**
-  **Modify**
-  **Update**
-  **Delete**
-  **Export**
-  **Lock** (for records)
-  **Restrict** (for records)
