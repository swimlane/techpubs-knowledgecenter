Settings

With Turbine Cloud, there is an administrator who has access to tenant
provisioning and a user/group definition. Then, within each tenant you
have local tenants administrators and orchestrators. To request
additional tenants, reach out to your Swimlane support representative.

Each tenant has its own account administrator. This account
administrator can:

-  Set up users, groups, and roles.
-  Assign and restrict create, read, update, and delete permissions.
-  Create additional account administrators.

Click `Tenant Management in Turbine
Cloud <../cloud/turbine-cloud/tenant-management-in-turbine-cloud.htm>`__
for additional information.

You are now a Turbine Administrator! Now what? You have access to
Turbine Settings, which control other global Turbine settings and
contain error and troubleshooting tools.

#. In the navigation menu to access the settings dashboard, click the
   **SETTINGS** icon.

   You can also hover over the icon and select from the available
   options.

In SETTINGS, administrators can:

-  Manage sessions and security
-  Enable/disable directory syncing
-  Review/update system details, i.e., system time zone workflow run
   TTL unit, etc.
-  Add connector keys
-  View the number of agents and pools

Click `Settings <../settings/settings.htm>`__ for additional
information.
