Branding Feature
================

Branding grants your the ability to prominently feature your logo and
co-brand your service name along with Swimlane Turbine logo. By default,
the Swimlane Turbine logo and service name appears.

**Note:** The **Branding** feature is behind a feature flag. To enable
**Branding** feature flag to your account, contact Swimlane support.

To enable **Branding**:

-  Click **SETTINGS** in the Admin panel, and click **Branding**.

-  Enter your company name in the **Company or Service name** field.

-  Browse for the logo or you can drag and drop the logo in the browse
   field.

   The accepted file formats are SVG and PNG with a minimum resolution
   of 512x512 pixels. For best results, use square logos with a
   transparent background.

**Note:** For Turbine cloud, the log in screen, the Favicon, the browser
title, the password reset form, and the loading spinner will still have
the Swimlane Turbine logo.
