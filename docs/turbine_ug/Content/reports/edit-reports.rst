Edit Reports
============

Reports are collections of records collected from a Swimlane Turbine
application. Reports can be customized through keyword searching and
filtering, saved to show the selected information, and shared with other
users.

You can create a new report from either APPLICATION RECORDS or REPORTS.
For details on how to create a new report, go to `Create and Save
Reports <create-and-save-reports.htm>`__.
