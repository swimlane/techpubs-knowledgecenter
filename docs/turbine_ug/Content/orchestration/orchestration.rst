Orchestration
=============

Orchestration integrates security tools and platforms to improve your
organization’s security intelligence and enhance context to enable
better and faster decision making. Turbine Canvas is a part of Swimlane
Orchestration, which combines machine learning, customer experience, and
artificial intelligence to serve as the system of record.

This improves:

-  Speed

-  Simplicity
