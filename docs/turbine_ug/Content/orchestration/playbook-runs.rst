Playbook Runs
=============

Playbook runs are the execution of playbooks.

As an orchestrator, you can view data about your playbook runs under the
ORCHESTRATION section.

This page shows:

-  A graph at the top that depicts the number of playbook runs over the
   course of the past six months.

-  The table shows playbook runs grouped by playbook.

In the table, you can see the playbook name, when the run started and
ended, and the trigger type.

A successful playbook run is indicated by a green dot. A failed playbook
run is indicated by a red dot. For additional details about the run,
click the expand arrow to the left of the **Name** column.
