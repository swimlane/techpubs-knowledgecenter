Lookup and Create References within Records
===========================================

You can select which field(s) to reference from within a record. A
reference field on a record, whether single-select, multi-select, or
grid, is accompanied by a New and Lookup button adjacent to the
reference field.

For more information about reference fields in general, see
`Reference <../../applications-and-applets/application-builder/select-fields-and-assign-field-properties/reference.htm>`__.

   The reference lookup searches for records within the referenced
   target application.

   | **Note:** If your application contains many records, this search
     can take some time.

2. Once the search has completed, review the results and select the
   record(s) you want to display.
