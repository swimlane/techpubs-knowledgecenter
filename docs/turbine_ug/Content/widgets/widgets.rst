Widgets
=======

Widgets are javascript components that you can use to enrich the User
Interface (UI) on records and dashboards.

The flexibility of Swimlane Turbine allows it to cover an unlimited
amount of use cases, many of which benefit from enhancements to the UI.
Widgets allow you to easily create your own UI components that interact
with Turbine or third-party endpoints and enrich your custom use cases,
as well as give you access to a growing set of widgets that cover common
use cases.

There are currently two types of widgets in Turbine: record widgets, and
report widgets.

Turbine's widgets, and their supporting code, are hosted here: `Swimlane
Platform Custom Widgets <https://swimlane.github.io/custom-widgets/>`__

From the custom widgets repository, you download applets that contain
the widgets in order to utilize them in your Turbine applications.

Web Components and Custom Elements
----------------------------------

Widgets are implemented as `web
components <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components>`__,
which are a web standard for defining reusable custom HTML elements.

Custom elements documentation can be found
`here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements>`__.
