Marketplace
===========

Turbine hosts `connectors <connectors.htm>`__ and
`components <components.htm>`__ in the Swimlane Content, which houses
drop-in content to boost your workflow. It's located in the Turbine
platform for easy, manageable access.

As an orchestrator, use the left-hand navigation menu to open
Marketplace.

For Turbine users who work with restrictive network environments (i.e.,
that block all outgoing traffic from Turbine by default), ensure that
you can reach the following external hosts to function properly:

-  `https://quay.io <https://quay.io/>`__

-  http://cdn.quay.io/

-  http://cdn01.quay.io/

-  http://cdn02.quay.io/

-  http://cdn03.quay.io/

-  `https://marketplace.swimlane.com <https://marketplace.swimlane.com/>`__
