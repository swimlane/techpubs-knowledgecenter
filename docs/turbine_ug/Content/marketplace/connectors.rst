Connectors
==========

Connectors are distributable packages that provide simplistic
integration functionality for an application/service and connect to
third-party tools.

You can install defined capabilities from third-party services/platforms
for use in playbooks, and then use input/output configuration with APIs
without using code.

**Note:** In the Swimlane platform, this was known as a plugin.
