Solutions and Applications
==========================

Turbine solutions are end-to-end use cases that contain components,
playbooks, and assets that are mostly preconfigured to reduce an
practitioner’s time and level of effort when creating common security
solutions.

Why use solutions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Helps newer users to learn Turbine

-  Accelerates user's self-sufficiency

-  Demonstrates playbook best practices

-  Saves time configuring a playbook from scratch, decreases user
   errors, and identifies established playbook practices for use in
   future playbooks

-  Achieves common outcomes quickly on an ongoing basis

Where can I find solutions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solutions are located in Turbine on the Integrated Marketplace, along
with components and connectors.

Applications in Solutions
-------------------------

See `Applications and
Applets <../applications-and-applets/applications-and-applets.htm>`__
for details about building and managing Turbine applications and
applets. You can use applications separately or with Turbine solutions.
Applications can assist with threat intelligence, case and incident
management, alert, and phishing triage, and any other situation where
interacting with records is required. This section provides information
for the processes, installation, and configuration on current Turbine
solutions and/or applications.
