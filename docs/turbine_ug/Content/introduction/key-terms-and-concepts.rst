Key Terms and Concepts
======================

Swimlane Turbine uses a variety of terms throughout this documentation
and the platform itself. The table below contains high-level definitions
of some of the key terms and concepts you will encounter using Turbine.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Term                             | Definition                       |
+==================================+==================================+
| **Administrator**                | An account created to enable     |
|                                  | access to the Turbine UI or API. |
|                                  | The administrator role in        |
|                                  | Turbine has access to all        |
|                                  | tenants, roles, groups,          |
|                                  | permissions, applications,       |
|                                  | reports, records, etc. The       |
|                                  | administrator role and           |
|                                  | permissions can be narrowed to   |
|                                  | meet business needs.             |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Agents**                       | Agents perform actions from      |
|                                  | playbooks, and then send those   |
|                                  | results back to the Turbine      |
|                                  | engine. Agents wait to accept    |
|                                  | jobs to execute actions from     |
|                                  | Turbine but will not initiate    |
|                                  | actions themselves to simplify   |
|                                  | network configuration.           |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Applet**                       | A preconfigured set of fields    |
|                                  | and layout specifications for    |
|                                  | Turbine. Applets are appended to |
|                                  | an existing application form     |
|                                  | layout and are designed to allow |
|                                  | users to easily update and       |
|                                  | expand their existing            |
|                                  | applications.                    |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Applet Builder**               | A form layout in Turbine for     |
|                                  | configuring applets.             |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Application**                  | A user-defined template for      |
|                                  | collecting, storing, and         |
|                                  | organizing your data. All        |
|                                  | automated activities and         |
|                                  | decisions are driven by how your |
|                                  | application stores data. You     |
|                                  | also manage workflow from within |
|                                  | applications.                    |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Application Builder**          | A form layout in Turbine for     |
|                                  | configuring applications.        |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Assets**                       | Reusable, structured, and        |
|                                  | vendor-specific collections of   |
|                                  | data that contribute to the      |
|                                  | success of Turbine actions.      |
|                                  | Assets allow users to create a   |
|                                  | reusable set of values that can  |
|                                  | be applied to actions as inputs  |
|                                  | in playbooks. Assets can be for  |
|                                  | a specific connector, or created |
|                                  | as a custom asset which can be   |
|                                  | applied to any action inputs.    |
|                                  | Assets are most useful for       |
|                                  | standardizing and securing       |
|                                  | configurations.                  |

|                                  | vary based on the action         |
|                                  | connector and/or assets, and may |
|                                  | include, but are not limited to: |
|                                  | IP addresses, file names, URLs,  |
|                                  | etc.                             |

|                                  | can have multiple cards on a     |
|                                  | single dashboard.                |

|                                  | terminology individual cases,    |
|                                  | events, alarms, alerts, etc. are |
|                                  | generalized as application       |

|                                  | systems to Turbine without the   |
|                                  | need to configure multiple VPNs  |
|                                  | or complex networks.             |

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Security Information and Event | Collects, aggregates, and then   |
| Management (SIEM)**              | identifies, categorizing and     |

|                                  | playbooks, assets, applications, |
|                                  | etc. into a Swimlane Turbine     |
|                                  | system.                          |

|                                  | which events and under what      |
|                                  | conditions a playbook should     |
|                                  | execute.                         |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **User**                         | An account created to enable     |
|                                  | access to the Turbine UI or API. |
|                                  | The user role differs from the   |
|                                  | administrator role in Turbine    |
|                                  | and typically has limited access |
|                                  | to administrator role            |
|                                  | functionality.                   |

| Webhooks                         | Expand actionability by enabling |
|                                  | products, vendors, and services  |
|                                  | to push real-time communication  |
|                                  | into Turbine                     |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| WebSockets                       | Communications between Swimlane  |
|                                  | Turbine (RabbitMQ) and the       |
|                                  | remote agents are over           |
|                                  | TLS-secured WebSockets on port   |
|                                  | 443. This streamlines the        |
|                                  | deployment of Turbine and        |
|                                  | prevents the need for additional |
|                                  | hostnames or infrastructure.     |

|                                  | that automate the presentation   |
|                                  | of record fields and layout.     |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Workflow Action**              | A single task within workflow,   |
|                                  | manually defined to respond to a |
|                                  | conditional decision point.      |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| **Workflow Condition**           | Decision-points programmed into  |
|                                  | workflow.                        |

|                                  | Turbine platform where you can   |
|                                  | organize and access the Turbine  |
|                                  | tools and features you use on a  |
|                                  | regular basis. Workspaces can    |
|                                  | include applications,            |
|                                  | dashboards, records, reports,    |
|                                  | and charts.                      |
