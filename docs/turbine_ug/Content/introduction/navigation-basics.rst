Navigation Basics
=================

Swimlane Turbine is organized into workspaces and dashboards where you
can view additional detail about the applications, records, and reports
that you manage within Turbine.

The workspaces, dashboards, records, reports, applications, and applets,
among other features in Turbine, are all permission-driven. A user must
give you permission as a user, or for your role within your
organization, to view or otherwise modify a specific feature of Turbine.

If you have administrator permissions on for users, groups or roles, or
playbooks, you will be able to view and access them from the Admin
portal. Admins then access workspaces, dashboards, and playbooks from
the global navigation menu.

**Important!** Access Turbine with the Google Chrome browser.

Profile Options
---------------

You access Profile Options from the upper-right corner of the Turbine
User Interface (UI). The Profile Options sub-menu is where you can begin
to complete the following basic steps:

-  **Profile & user settings:** edit user details, set password and
   personal access token, and see activity
-  **Documentation:** access Turbine platform documentation
-  **This version of Turbine:** see Turbine version, build, and
   copyright information
-  **Admin Panel**: (Admin users only) access the admin panel for the
   Account
-  **Sign out:** end active user session

the Turbine UI. For more information, see `Search Record
Data <../records/search-record-data.htm>`__.
