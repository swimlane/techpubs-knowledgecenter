Playbooks Classic
=================

 

Turbine is constantly growing and enhancing. As this happens, Swimlane
wants users to have access to current and/or previous playbook access
and functionality.

As a Turbine orchestrator, you can navigate to ORCHESTRATION and see
four sections regarding playbooks: **Playbooks NEW**, **Playbook Runs
NEW**, **Playbooks CLASSIC**, and\ **Playbook Runs CLASSIC**. Clicking
the CLASSIC sections navigates you to Turbine's last version before the
introduction of Turbine Canvas where you can still create modular,
repeatable automations that process real-time data.

 

**Note:** The features did not change and you can still upload, edit,
and export playbooks as SSPs.
