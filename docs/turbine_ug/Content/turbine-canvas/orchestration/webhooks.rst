Webhooks are a type of event stream that enables products, vendors, or
services to push real-time communication in Turbine. They process and
enrich data to send from third-party services and platforms to Turbine
records.

webhooks show automatically sorted alphabetically and by playbook. If a
playbook has more than one webhook, all of the webhooks will display
under the playbook's name. You can use the features listed in the table
to navigate the webhooks homepage for a faster and easier experience.
