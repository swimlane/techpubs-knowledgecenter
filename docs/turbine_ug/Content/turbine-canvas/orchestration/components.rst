Components
==========

**Components** can be:

-  Filtered by **User-made**

-  Sorted by **Source** or **Interface**

To add an action or component, click on the desired action/component,
then drag to the expanding responsive drop zone. The circle expands to
show you when you're at the optimal range to drop in your action into
your flow. Repeat to add additional actions/components. For more
information, see `Components <canvas-components.htm>`__.
