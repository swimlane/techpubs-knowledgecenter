Transform Data
==============

One of the most common data transformation jobs is converting data to
specific formats. Historically, this operation has required Python or
JSONata expertise. Turbine eliminates this need by using a
transformation action in a playbook.

Basic Transformation Action Set Up
----------------------------------

Time to start basic set-up for the Transform Data action.

You have already created a playbook, and you are ready to transform the
data from a property.

#. From your playbook, click **Add an action**.

#. From the ACTION panel, click the **Action** drop-down.

#. Select **Transform Data** and then click **Configure**.

   The transformation builder opens.

   Click the pencil icon and change the block name. Turbine also
   automatically updates the block name in snake case. To duplicate the
   block, simply click the |image3| icon.

   |image4|

   If you have already clicked Apply, then later return to a
   transformation block to rename it, the original block name does not
   change. Just like actions, click the lock icon to change the name.

   However, a warning dialog opens to remind you that changing the key
   name could potentially break downstream actions, if the block is
   referenced or used downstream in the playbook.

   From the Transform tab:

4. In Block 1, on the **FIRST** line, click the **Select a
   Transformation** drop-down and select a transformation type.

**Warning!** Wait until you have completely configured the entire block
(the FIRST and THEN rows) before adding a new Block to configure.

#. Once you complete the configuration, click **TRANSFORM AGAIN**.

The next line in the block is **THEN**. If necessary, select the next
transformation action to apply to the output of the previous line.

Marking Data as Sensitive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your data has any sensitive information, you can mark as sensitive by
clicking the **Contains sensitive data** checkbox. The data is not shown
in the UI or in the logs.

Basic Transformation Use Cases

Cases <../../use-cases/native-action-use-cases/transform-data-date-time-examples.htm>`__
