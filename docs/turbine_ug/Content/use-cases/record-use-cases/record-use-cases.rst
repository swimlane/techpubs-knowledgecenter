Record Use Cases
================

There are three possible scenarios that can occur with record linking
when mapping playbook outputs to an application. Let's watch as Max
works through all three use cases.

Use Case 1: No record linking applied
-------------------------------------

   **Issue:** The **No record linking applied** button is disabled

..

   **Cause:** There is no record event/record action trigger

`Scenario 1
documentation <no-record-linking-applied-button-disabled-use-cases.htm>`__

Use Case 2: No record linking applied
-------------------------------------

   **Issue:** The **No record linking applied** is disabled

..

   **Cause:** The triggering application does not have a reference field
   for the application to which the playbook outputs are being mapped

`Scenario 2
documentation <no-record-linking-applied-button-disabled-use-cases.htm>`__

Use Case 3: Link records successfully when the button is enabled
----------------------------------------------------------------

This use case shows how to link records successfully when the button is
enabled.

   **Scenario 3: You are in a playbook and want to map an output record
   to the input record that triggers the playbook.**
