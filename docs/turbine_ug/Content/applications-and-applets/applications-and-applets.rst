Applications and Applets
========================

Applications and Applets are the foundation of the Swimlane Turbine
platform.

**What is an application?**

A user-defined template for collecting, storing, and organizing your
data. All automated activities and decisions are driven by how your
application stores data. You also manage workflow from within
applications.

**What is an applet?**

A preconfigured set of fields and layout specifications. Applets are
appended to an existing application form layout and allow users to
easily update and expand their existing applications.

This section lists all the Applications and Applets that have been
created and are available on this Turbine instance. You can filter the
list by type (Application and Applets), or by a search string that you
enter.

Each Application and Applet provides a management menu with viewing
options, copy and export options, and a delete option.

To review or reconfigure the application, click **Builder**.
