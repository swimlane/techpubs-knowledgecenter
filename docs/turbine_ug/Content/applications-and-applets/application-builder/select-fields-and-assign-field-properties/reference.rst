Reference
=========

Use a reference field to add a reference to another record, either from
the current application or from another application.

For example, consider that you have an application called Address with
these fields: Address, Zip Code, City, Country; and another application
called Employee with these fields: First Name, Last Name. A reference
field in the Employee application called "Home Address" could link to
the Address application and contain the fields Address and Zip Code.
When creating a record in the Employee application, a pre-existing
Address record can be referenced, or a new one can be created and
referenced on the spot.

When creating a reference field, you can choose from these reference
types:

+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Field Type        | Description                                     |
+===================+=================================================+
| **Single-select** | Use to reference a single record.               |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Multi-select**  | Use to reference multiple records.              |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| **Grid**          | Use to reference multiple records with          |
|                   | additional, user-specified, field details.      |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Create Reference Fields
-----------------------

To create reference fields:

From Application Builder's Field Types, click **Reference** and then
select which Reference Type you want to create. Drag the reference field
to the Form Layout and drop it in the layout area, or within a Tab or
Section layout object.

Access the field's properties and complete the following fields as
needed:

+------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| Field            | Step                   | Example                |
+==================+========================+========================+
| **Display Name** | Enter the name of the  | *User Reference*       |
|                  | field.                 |                        |
+------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| **Help Text**    | Enter contextual help  | *Review referenced     |
|                  | text. You will first   | fields.*               |
|                  | need to specify        |                        |
|                  | whether the help text  |                        |
|                  | will appear above or   |                        |
|                  | below the field in the |                        |
|                  | record form, and then  |                        |
|                  | you can enter the      |                        |
|                  | text.                  |                        |
+------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

Next, consider the following advanced options in the FIELD PROPERTIES
tab:

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

Add specific field-level permissions by role, if needed, and then click
**Apply.**

Create or Select an Application to Reference
--------------------------------------------

You can select an existing application to reference, or you can create a
new application to reference from within reference fields.

To select an existing application click **Reference Application.** The
pull-down menu displays all applications that you have access to that
contain reference fields. Select the application.

|image2|

To create a new application to reference from within a reference field,
create a reference field, then in the Field Properties click **Create
New Application to Reference**.

A dialog window prompts you to create the new application. Once you
create the new application, the click **Create.** The dialog closes, and
the new application opens in a new tab in your browser. The new
application is also updated in the **Reference Application** field.

**Note:** To see the new application in a new tab in your browser,
ensure that you have turned off any web browser pop-up blockers.

You can identify a specific field to reference from record creation. For
more information, see `Lookup and Create References within
Records <../../../records/modify-a-record/lookup-and-create-references-in-records.htm>`__.

Create Reciprocal References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also create references that use or rely on data from other
reference fields, or reciprocal references.

To create a reciprocal reference, you must first ensure that you have
two applications with references set up. Then, select the target
reference field's application as the Reference Application.

Once the target reference application is selected, click the **Create
and maintain reciprocal reference** option.
