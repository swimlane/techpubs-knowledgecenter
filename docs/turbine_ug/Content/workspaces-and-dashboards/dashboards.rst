Dashboards
==========

A Swimlane Turbine dashboard is a visual display of records, reports,
and charts associated with the applications in the workspace. The
dashboard consists of cards. A workspace can have multiple dashboards.

**Note:** Users only have access to see Workspaces, Dashboards, Records,
and Reports if they are given access by an administrator. If a Dashboard
or a Report is not visible, an administrator would need to check that
the user has been assigned proper permissions.

Dashboards are built using Cards that may contain filtered data from
your Reports. Each Card can be independently sized or reconfigured as
necessary.

Each Dashboard has a vertical ellipsis menu for managing **DASHBOARD**,
**WORKSPACE AND SHARING OPTIONS**.

To see the Applications that are included in this workspace and access
their default reports, click **APPLICATIONÂ RECORDS**.
