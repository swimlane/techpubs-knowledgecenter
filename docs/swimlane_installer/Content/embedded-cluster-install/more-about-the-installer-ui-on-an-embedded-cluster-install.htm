        <h1 id="more-about-the-installer-ui-on-an-embedded-cluster-install">More About the Installer UI on an Embedded Cluster Install</h1>
        <p>The Swimlane Platform Installer UI is where you manage your application, version history, and configuration settings. This topic gives you more detail about the functional tabs in the Swimlane Platform Installer UI.</p>
        <h2 id="dashboard-tab">Dashboard Tab</h2>
        <p>On the Dashboard tab you can view the status of your application, as well as the status of your install, upgrade or snapshot restoration. You can also easily access the version history, snapshots, and license details.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/admin_console_dashboard.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Scroll down to view charts and data on Disk Usage, CPU Usage, and Memory Usage.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 id="version-history-tab">Version History Tab</h2>
        <p>On the Version history tab you can view your currently deployed version of Swimlane as well as any previous versions. Any changes you make to your configuration will display here as well. You can also redeploy previous versions from this tab and view the differences between versions.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/install_version_history.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Click view logs to see your installation logs.</p>
        <h2 id="config-tab">Config Tab</h2>
        <p>On the Config tab you can review the configuration settings you set when you first installed Swimlane.</p>
        <p class="important"><strong>Important!</strong> Do not attempt to reset the passwords for your install on this tab!</p>
        <h2 id="troubleshoot-tab">Troubleshoot Tab</h2>
        <p>On the Troubleshoot tab you can generate support bundles that will help you troubleshoot issues with your Swimlane instance.</p>
        <p>Click <strong>Analyze Swimlane</strong> to generate a support bundle. Most of the files in a support bundle are default files, but you can also check Mongo pods for disk space or see how much space is free. You can also check API logs. Click <strong>Download bundle</strong> to download it locally and send to Swimlane for investigation.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3 id="configure-redaction">Configure Redaction</h3>
        <p>You can set up your support bundle to redact sensitive information such as database connection strings, passwords and other API tokens. The redaction is both built in and extensible.</p>
        <p>The redactions are defined within a YAML file that defines which data to remove when creating a support bundle. Here is an example of a Redactor YAML file:</p>
        <MadCap:codeSnippet>
            <codeSnippetCopyButton />
            <codeSnippetBody>apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: Redactor
metadata:
  name: my-redactor-name
spec:
  redactors:
  - name: replace password # names are not used internally, but are useful for recordkeeping
    fileSelector:
      file: data/my-password-dump # this targets a single file
    removals:
      values:
      - abc123 # this value is my password, and should never appear in a support bundle
  - name: all files # as no file is specified, this redactor will run against all files
    removals:
      regex:
      - redactor: (another)(?P&lt;mask&gt;.*)(here) # this will replace anything between the strings `another` and `here` with `***HIDDEN***`
      - selector: 'S3_ENDPOINT' # remove the value in lines following those that contain the string S3_ENDPOINT
        redactor: '("value": ").*(")'
      yamlPath:
      - "abc.xyz.*" # redact all items in the array at key xyz within key abc in yaml documents
</codeSnippetBody>
        </MadCap:codeSnippet>
        <p>To define a redaction, prior to creating your support bundle, click <strong>Configure redaction</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/configure_redaction.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>An editor opens where you can write your own specifications for redaction or link to an existing YAML specification.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/write_spec.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>If you have technical questions about how to write up a redaction, contact your Swimlane support representative.</p>
        <h2 id="snapshots-tab">Snapshots Tab</h2>
        <p>For information on snapshots see <a href="backup-and-restore-on-an-embedded-cluster-with-snapshots.htm">Backup and Restore on an Embedded Cluster with Snapshots</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="license-tab">License Tab</h2>
        <p>The license tab shows information about the SPI license used for your environment. The <code>Sync license</code> button should only be used when instructed by Swimlane to sync a new expiration date or entitlements for your SPI license.</p>
        <h2 id="view-files-tab">View Files Tab</h2>
        <p>The view files tab shows the underlying configuration files for the SPI admin console and is used for troubleshooting purposes when necessary by the  Swimlane support team. The instructions shown under the <code>Need to edit these files?</code> link are for Swimlane support troubleshooting only and should not be used.</p>
        <h2 id="registry-settings-tab">Registry Settings Tab</h2>
        <p>The registry settings tab is not supported or used at this time.</p>
