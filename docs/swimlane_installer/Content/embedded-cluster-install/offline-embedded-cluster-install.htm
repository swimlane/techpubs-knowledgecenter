        <p>If you need to do an offline installation of Swimlane with the Swimlane Platform Installer, you will need the offline installer package, and an airgap bundle. The airgap bundle works with the Installer to allow an offline install.</p>
        <p>Airgap installs require a jumpbox that has access to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the internet</li>
            <li>the airgapped network</li>
            <li>a browser, from which you can access the Swimlane Platform Installer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before you begin, copy the offline installer package to the jumpbox and then to each node in the cluster.</p>
        <p>To perform an offline install with the Swimlane Platform Installer:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Copy the offline installer package to the instance that will become the first cluster primary node and untar the package with the following command:</li>
            <p><code>tar zxvf &lt;your file name&gt;.tar.gz</code>
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Next, run this install command:</li>
            <p><code>cat install.sh | sudo bash -s airgap ha</code>
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Once install completes, save the URL and password that the install generates. In addition, copy the add primary node command to use to add additional masters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy the offline installer package to an additional primary node.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Untar the offline installer package.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Run the add primary node command that you copied in step 3, above.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Repeat steps 4 through 6 above until all nodes have been installed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, run <code>kubectl get nodes</code> to make sure each node is ready.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy the airgap bundle to the jumpbox.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a Chrome browser, enter the URL and password for the Swimlane Platform Installer UI (from the original install command). Upload your .yaml license file and proceed until you are prompted to upload the airgap bundle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Upload the airgap bundle.</p>
            </li>
            <p>After the airgap bundle is uploaded and processed, see the <a href="configure-the-swimlane-platform-for-an-embedded-cluster-install.htm">Configure the Swimlane Platform for an Embedded Cluster Install</a> topic to configure and deploy Swimlane.</p>
