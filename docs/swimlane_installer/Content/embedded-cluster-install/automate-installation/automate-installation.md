Automate Installation
#####=

These topics will walk you through `Automating an Online
Installation <automate-an-online-embedded-installation.htm>`__ or
`Automating an Offline
Installation <automate-an-offline-embedded-installation.htm>`__
installation of Swimlane Platform Installer (SPI) with an embedded
Kubernetes cluster.

Before attempting an automated installation, refer to our `system
requirements <../system-requirements-for-an-embedded-cluster-install/system-requirements-for-an-embedded-cluster-install.htm>`__
to ensure your systems' compliance. Also, for a thorough explanation of
the overall installation process, refer to the manual steps for an
online or offline installation.

Embedded Cluster SPI Config File
################

The automation of an SPI installation requires several files including a
valid `SPI Config
File <embedded-cluster-spi-config-file.htm#creating-an-spi-config-file>`__
which defines specifics of the deployed SPI environment. View this
config file for an explanation of all of the configurable options. It is
based off of the options chosen when you `Configure the Swimlane
Platform <../configure-the-swimlane-platform-for-an-embedded-cluster-install.htm>`__.
Swimlane recommendeds to initially manually deploy SPI, set up your
desired configuration in the SPI Config UI, and then download the
resultant SPI config file from there and modify that as opposed to
building one from scratch with these instructions.
