        <p>These topics will walk you through <a href="automate-an-online-embedded-installation.htm">Automating an Online Installation</a> or <a href="automate-an-offline-embedded-installation.htm">Automating an Offline Installation</a> installation of Swimlane Platform Installer (SPI) with an embedded Kubernetes cluster.</p>
        <p>Before attempting an automated installation, refer to our <a href="../system-requirements-for-an-embedded-cluster-install/system-requirements-for-an-embedded-cluster-install.htm">system requirements</a> to ensure your systems' compliance. Also, for a thorough explanation of the overall installation process, refer to the manual steps for an online or offline installation.</p>
        <h2>Embedded Cluster SPI Config File</h2>
        <p>The automation of an SPI installation requires several files including a valid <a href="embedded-cluster-spi-config-file.htm#creating-an-spi-config-file">SPI Config File</a> which defines specifics of the deployed SPI environment. View this config file for an explanation of all of the configurable options. It is based off of the options chosen when you <a href="../configure-the-swimlane-platform-for-an-embedded-cluster-install.htm">Configure the Swimlane Platform</a>. Swimlane recommendeds to initially manually deploy SPI, set up your desired configuration in the SPI Config UI, and then download the resultant SPI config file from there and modify that as opposed to building one from scratch with these instructions. </p>
