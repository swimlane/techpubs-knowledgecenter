        <p>By default, the Swimlane Platform Installer uses 10.32.0.0/20 for podCIDR and 10.96.0.0/22 for serviceCIDR. If these are in use in your network and routable by the cluster nodes, the internal cluster IP ranges will need to be overridden. However, the installer also includes logic to find an available subnet automatically anywhere in the 10.0.0.0/8 network. As long as the excluded subnets appear in an IP route it should find one without conflicts.</p>
        <p>To override the defaults, you can add serviceCIDR (under the kubernetes spec) and podCIDR (under the flannel spec) to the installer-override.yaml patch file <code>spec:</code> section.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <MadCap:codeSnippet>
            <codeSnippetCopyButton />
            <codeSnippetBody>apiVersion: cluster.kurl.sh/v1beta1
kind: Installer
metadata:
  name: "patch"
spec:
  kubernetes:
    serviceCIDR: "&lt;your custom subnet&gt;"
  flannel:
    podCIDR: "&lt;your custom subnet&gt;"
</codeSnippetBody>
        </MadCap:codeSnippet>
        <p>Alternatively, you can leave serviceCIDR blank, and set serviceCidrRange to 22 or /22. Then at install time, the installer will try to discover a /22 subnet to use, which does not overlap with any IP routes already present on the host.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you provide an invalid CIDR, you may run into issues with the installer hanging during the installation process.</p>
