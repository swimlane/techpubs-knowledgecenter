Deploy with an External MongoDB Cluster
#########===

__Important!__ Due to ongoing incompatibilities, Swimlane does not
support using Amazon DocumentDB as an option for external MongoDB
Cluster deployment.

__Also Important!__ The physical location of the external Mongo
deployment, as it pertains to latency between the Swimlane cluster and
the standalone Mongo instance, performs best with a latency delay of
less than 5 milliseconds. Be aware that with every added millisecond of
latency, Swimlane's performance drops linearly.

Â 

There are two primary deployment models for using an external MongoDB
cluster with Swimlane:

-  `Self-Hosted MongoDB Cluster <#self-hosted-mongodb-cluster>`__

-  `MongoDB Atlas <#mongodb-atlas>`__

General Requirements
##########

MongoDB version 4.4 is currently the only supported version for any
external deployment.

Self-Hosted MongoDB Cluster
############---

Customer-maintained MongoDB clusters are supported as long as the
external MongoDB cluster meets the requirements listed in the `System
Requirements <system-requirements-for-an-embedded-cluster-install/system-requirements-for-an-embedded-cluster-install.htm>`__
for embedded clusters.

To help with troubleshooting, Swimlane recommends that you name your
databases `Swimlane` and `SwimlaneHistory` in your deployment. In
each database, also create a `Swimlane` user and ensure that it is
assigned the `dbOwner` role.

MongoDB Atlas
######-

You can use MongoDB Atlas as an external MongoDB cluster as long as the
cluster has been configured to use a computer tier that aligns with the
System Requirements for
`Existing <../existing-cluster-install/system-requirements-for-an-existing-cluster-install/system-requirements-for-an-existing-cluster-install.htm>`__
or
`Embedded <system-requirements-for-an-embedded-cluster-install/system-requirements-for-an-embedded-cluster-install.htm>`__
System Requirements page. Dedicated M40 clusters are the minimum compute
tier required for an external MongoDB cluster.

After creating your Atlas cluster, you must create two databases along
with two users for those databases. Swimlane recommends that you name
your databases `Swimlane` and `SwimlaneHistory` in your deployment.
In each database, also create a `Swimlane` user.

Users, databases, and roles are all managed through the Atlas UI. Atlas
does not have a "dbOwner" role that would be used in self-hosted
clusters. Instead, your created users should be assigned the specific
advanced privileges `dbAdmin` and `readWrite`. Additionally, you can
scope the permissions of each user to their respective databases,
although it is not required.

__Note__ The built-in role "Read and write to any database" is not
sufficient, as Swimlane requires the ability to create indexes in
MongoDB, which is a dbAdmin privilege.

Configuring External Mongo in the Swimlane Platform Installer
##############################-

When you select the __Use an external MongoDB deployment__ option, the
SPI UI hides all of the embedded mongo options and displays these
sections __MongoDB Swimlane Database Settings__ and __MongoDB Swimlane
History Database Settings__.

Both of these sections set their respective database's configuration and
contain the same options as described here:

__MongoDB prefix:__ Describes the prefix of the MongoDB connection
string. The default value is `mongodb://`, however `mongodb+srv://`
is also a valid prefix. This prefix is common when using MongoDB Atlas.

__MongoDB username:__ The username for the user associated with the
relevant database that is being configured, either _Swimlane_ or
_SwimlaneHistory_.

__MongoDB Password:__ The password for the user associated with the
relevant database that's being configured, either _Swimlane_ or
_SwimlaneHistory_.

__MongoDB hostname list:__ The hostname or set of hostnames for the
MongoDB cluster. For multi-node clusters, this is usually in the form of
a comma-separated list of hostnames and ports. In Atlas deployments,
this can be the SRV record for the cluster provided by the Atlas UI.

__MongoDB database:__ The database name relevant to the database that's
being configured, either _Swimlane_ or _SwimlaneHistory_.

__Upload TLS certificates to use in the MongoDB connection URI
options:__ Enables the uploading of a CA certificate if the MongoDB
cluster uses an internal CA.

__MongoDB connection options:__ Provides additional options to the
connection string. Currently, the __only__ supported options are `ssl`
and `sslVerifyCertificates`.
