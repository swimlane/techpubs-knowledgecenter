        <h1 id="swimlane-platform-installer">Swimlane Platform Installer Guide</h1>
        <p>The Swimlane Platform Installer (SPI) is an administrative console where you can access and manage your Swimlane instance. It is also where you will go to access upgrades to new Swimlane releases, as well as any updates to the installer itself. The installer consists of an Application tab where you manage your application, version history, configuration settings, as well as a Cluster Management tab and a Snapshots tab.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Cluster Management is where you view, drain, and add nodes to your instance. Follow the installation steps based on how you are managing your clusters.</p>
