        <h1 id="automate-installation">Automate Installation</h1>
        <p>These topics will walk you through <a href="automate-an-online-existing-installation.htm">Automating an Online Installation</a> or <a href="automate-an-air-gapped-existing-cluster-installation.htm">Automating an Air-Gapped Existing Cluster Installation</a> of the Swimlane Platform Installer (SPI) into an existing Kubernetes cluster.</p>
        <p>Before attempting an automated installation, refer to the existing cluster <a href="../system-requirements-for-an-existing-cluster-install/system-requirements-for-an-existing-cluster-install.htm">system requirements</a> to ensure your systems' compliance. Also, for a thorough explanation of the overall installation process, refer to the manual steps for an online or offline installation.</p>
        <h4 id="existing-cluster-spi-config-file">Existing Cluster SPI Config File</h4>
        <p>The automation of an SPI installation requires several files including a valid <a href="existing-cluster-spi-config-file.htm#creating-an-spi-config-file">SPI Config File</a> which defines specifics of the deployed SPI environment. This file is based off of the options chosen when you <a href="../configure-the-swimlane-platform-for-an-existing-cluster-install.htm">Configure the Swimlane Platform</a>. It is recommended to initially, manually deploy SPI, set up your desired configuration in the SPI Config UI, and then download the resultant SPI config file from there and modify that as opposed to building one from scratch with these instructions. For an explanation of all the configurable options in an SPI config file refer to the <a href="existing-cluster-spi-config-file.htm">Existing Cluster SPI Config File</a> page.</p>
