Configure the Swimlane Platform for an Existing Cluster Install
###############===

When you need to access the SPI UI after the initial install you can
proxy it again by running this command and accessing
http://localhost:8800 in a Chrome browser:

kubectl kots admin-console --namespace your-namespace

__Note:__ All configuration of the Swimlane Platform Installer and
Swimlane platform must be done through the SPI admin console config
page. Editing or manipulating the underlying Kubernetes resources is not
supported and will not be permanent since they are managed and
controlled by the Swimlane Platform Installer.

#. First, configure ingress options.

   -  Enable Ingress Resource - Enable this option if you have an
      existing ingress controller installed in your cluster that you
      want to utilize to expose Swimlane externally.

      -  Ingress Resource Annotations - Enter the annotations to apply
         to the ingress resource. See the documentation for your ingress
         controller for the required annotations to work properly.

         -  If your ingress controller requires a NodePort service then
            you must enabled the Expose the Swimlane Web Service
            Externally option below.

      -  Ingress Resource TLS - Enter the TLS section for the ingress
         resource. See your ingress controllerâ€™s documentation for the
         required TLS settings. See the Kubernetes documentation for
         valid ingress `TLS
         YAML <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls>`__.

   -  Ingress Resource Hostnames - Enter the hostnames to match to this
      ingress resource. Enter one per line with each line starting with
      a dash and a space (e.g. "- hostname.example"). You must use
      DNS-compliant records. A DNS record can be up to 63-characters
      long and can only contain letters, numbers, and hyphens. The
      record cannot start or end with a hyphen, or have consecutive
      hyphens. If left blank, it will match all hostnames.

      -  Expose the Swimlane Web Service Externally - Enable this option
         to expose the Swimlane web service as a NodePort from each node
         in the cluster on the TCP port below. You must configure your
         external layer 7 load balancer to forward to each node over the
         chosen port.

         -  Swimlane Web Service Port - Enter the port to use for the
            externally exposed Swimlane Web Service. This port must be
            within your cluster's NodePort range. If left blank, it will
            use a random port in your cluster's NodePort range.

      -  Set Swimlane Web Service Annotations - Enter the annotations to
         apply to the Swimlane Web service. See the documentation for
         your ingress controller for the required annotations to work
         properly.

      -  Upload a certificate for Swimlane Web backend - Enable this
         option to upload a certificate and key to be used by the
         backend Swimlane web service. If no certificate is uploaded a
         self-signed one will be used.

   -  Swimlane Web CORS Headers - Enable this option to set HTTP
      Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Headers for Swimlane Web. A list of
      options relevant to CORS Headers will appear below and if left
      blank, they will be set with the default values specified next to
      each option. If this option is disabled, no CORS headers will be
      set for Swimlane Web.

      -  Swimlane Web CORS Header Access-Control-Allow-Origin -
         Determine whether to override the value for the `HTTP
         Access-Control-Allow-Origin
         header <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin>`__.

      -  Swimlane Web CORS Header Access-Control-Allow-Headers -
         Determine whether to override the value for the `HTTP
         Access-Control-Allow-Headers
         header <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers>`__.

      -  Swimlane Web CORS Header Access-Control-Allow-Methods -
         Determine whether to override the value for the `HTTP
         Access-Control-Allow-Methods
         header <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods>`__.

   -  Swimlane Web CSP Header - Enable this option to set the HTTP
      Content Security Policy Header for Swimlane Web. A new option will
      appear below to override the CSP header, if left blank it will get
      set to the default value. If this option is disabled, no CSP
      header will be set for Swimlane Web.

      -  Swimlane Web Content-Security-Policy Header - Determine whether
         to override the value for the `HTTP Content-Security-Policy
         header <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy>`__.

2. Next, set the logging settings.

   -  ASP.NET Hosting Environment - Set this option to Development to
      have stack traces sent to the browser for 500 errors. Set this
      option to Production to not send them.

   -  Enable Swimlane Audit Logging - Enable this option to log raw
      Swimlane API requests and responses into Swimlane pods.

   -  Swimlane Logging Level - Set this option to specify the logging
      level for Swimlane pods.

3. Next, determine whether to override the OpenSSL settings for
   CipherString and MinProtocol for outgoing secure connections that
   originate from API and Tasks pods.

4. Next, determine whether to enable the Swimlane Syslog Receiver and
   the Selenium ChromeDriver.

   -  Enable the Swimlane Syslog Receiver

      -  Swimlane Syslog Receiver Port - Enter the port to use for the
         externally exposed Swimlane Syslog Receiver service. This port
         must be within your cluster's NodePort range. If left blank, it
         will use a random port in your cluster's NodePort range.

      -  Enable the Selenium ChromeDriver

      |image1|

5. Determine whether you want MongoDB to be exposed for external access,
   and whether to pload Pip Config for API and Tasks.

   -  Expose MongoDB Externally - Enable this option to expose each
      MongoDB pod as a NodePort from each node in the cluster. Each one
      will use a random port in your cluster's NodePort range.

   -  Upload Pip Config for API and Tasks

   |image2|

6. If you have third-party certificates for API and tasks, click Upload
   Additional Trusted Certificates for API and Tasks and then browse for
   and upload your certificates.

   -  Upload Additional Trusted Certificates for API and Tasks

7. Next, choose whether to enable or disable a pod liveness probe for
   the API and Tasks pods. The default liveness probe setting for API
   pods is disabled and for Tasks pods is enabled.

8. On Initial MongoDB Settings, enter the appropriate encryption keys
   and passwords for your Swimlane database and MongoDB.

9. Next, set the MongoDB volume size and StorageClass.

   -  MongoDB Volume Size (GB) - The size in GB for the MongoDB
      persistent volume.

   -  StorageClass for MongoDB Data - The StorageClass to use for the
      MongoDB persistent volume.

10. Next, set the HA Environment settings for this cluster.

11. Next, set the affinity settings.

    -  Use Simple Pod Affinity - Use simplified affinity options to
       decide how to balance the Swimlane and MongoDB pods across your
       cluster nodes.

12. Next, set the service account settings.

    -  Automatically Create and Set the Service Account Used by the
       Swimlane Tools Deployment - When enabled, a service account,
       role, and role binding named swimlane-backup will be created in
       the namespace Swimlane is installed in that will be used by the
       Swimlane Tools deployment. This service account requires special
       permissions in order for the Swimlane Tools deployment to process
       snapshots and support bundles. Uncheck this if you want to create
       the service account manually and then enable the Set the service
       account option and define the name of it below.

       -  Kubernetes Service Account Name for the Swimlane Tools
          Deployment - The service account name to use for the Swimlane
          Tools Deployment.

    -  Set Service Accounts - Enable this if you need to set the
       Kubernetes serviceAccountName for each pod type. Pod types that
       don't require special settings can be left blank. See `Service
       Account Permissions <service-account-permissions.htm>`__ for more
       information on the required permissions for the pod types that
       require it.

13. Next, set the pod annotations settings.

    -  Set Pod Annotations - Enable this if you need to to set pod
       annotations for the Swimlane deployments. Pod types that don't
       require special settings can be left blank. See the `Kubernetes
       Annotations <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#syntax-and-character-set>`__
