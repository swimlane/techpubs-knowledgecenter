        <h1 id="upload-a-new-tls-certificate">Upload a New TLS Certificate</h1>
        <p>If you've already gone through the setup process once, and you want to upload new TLS certificates, run this command to restore the ability to upload new TLS certificates:</p>
        <MadCap:codeSnippet>
            <codeSnippetCopyButton />
            <codeSnippetBody>kubectl -n default annotate secret kotsadm-tls acceptAnonymousUploads=1
</codeSnippetBody>
        </MadCap:codeSnippet>
        <p class="important"><strong>Important!</strong> Adding this annotation temporarily creates a vulnerability for an attacker to maliciously upload TLS certificates. Once TLS certificates have been uploaded again, the vulnerability goes away.</p>
        <p>After adding the annotation, you will need to restart the kurl proxy server. The simplest way to do that is to delete the kurl-proxy pod (the pod will automatically get restarted) with this command:</p>
        <MadCap:codeSnippet>
            <codeSnippetCopyButton />
            <codeSnippetBody>kubectl delete pods PROXY_SERVER
</codeSnippetBody>
        </MadCap:codeSnippet>
        <p>This command provides you with the name of the kurl-proxy server:</p>
        <MadCap:codeSnippet>
            <codeSnippetCopyButton />
            <codeSnippetBody>kubectl get pods -A | grep kurl-proxy | awk '{print $2}'
</codeSnippetBody>
        </MadCap:codeSnippet>
        <p>After the pod has been restarted, re-direct your browser to <code>http://&lt;your_ip&gt;:8800/tls</code> to see the same page that you did during the initial installation. Then, load your TLS certificate:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ssl_certificate.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Swimlane recommends that you complete this process as soon as possible in order to avoid anyone from nefariously uploading TLS certificates. After this process is complete, the vulnerability is closed, and uploading new TLS certificates will be disallowed again. Please repeat the steps above in order to upload new TLS certificates.</p>
