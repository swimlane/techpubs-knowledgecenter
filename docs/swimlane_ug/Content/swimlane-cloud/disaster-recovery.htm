        <p>This topic contains an outline of how Swimlane supports you in case of data disaster and recovery.</p>
        <p>Swimlane stores snapshots in multiple geographic regions. In the event of a disaster, the infrastructure will be rebuilt in a working region and the most recent snapshot will be restored.</p>
        <p>All Swimlane information assets are assigned a sensitivity level based on the appropriate audience for the information. If the information has been previously classified by regulatory, legal, contractual, or company directive, then that classification will take precedence.</p>
        <p>Swimlane Recovery Time Objective (RTO) SLA is 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Swimlane meets many if not all HIPAA requirements and prohibits the collection of PII for purposes other than those communicated to the data subject or relevant entity.</p>
