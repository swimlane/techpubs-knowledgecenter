        <p>Access to Swimlane cloud is over HTTPS encrypted with TLS 1.2. Inbound traffic is protected by a web application firewall (WAF). Data is then load balanced across dedicated infrastructure in multiple zones for high availability. Outbound traffic to external integrations is protected by an egress firewall and data stored in Swimlane is encrypted at-rest using the AES-256 algorithm.</p>
