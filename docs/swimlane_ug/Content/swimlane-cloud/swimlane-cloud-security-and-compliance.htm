        <h1 id="swimlane-cloud-security-and-compliance">Swimlane Cloud Security and Compliance</h1>
        <p>Swimlane is designed to enable you to securely access and manage your content. Technical and physical controls within Swimlane prevent the disclosure of content as well as the unauthorized access to content. The infrastructure is continuously monitored, and vulnerability testing is conducted regularly by internal and external security staff.</p>
        <p>Swimlane extensively leverages security automation and response to alert suspicious activity across customer and corporate environments. Internally, confidentiality requirements are communicated to employees through training and policies. Employees are required to attend security awareness training, which includes information, policies, and procedures related to protecting our customers’ data.</p>
        <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
        <p>Swimlane provides a number of security features within Swimlane Cloud which helps ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer information.</p>
        <h3 id="data-at-rest">Data at Rest</h3>
        <p>Here is how Swimlane Cloud protects your data at rest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>All customer data and application snapshots are encrypted using the AES256 encryption algorithm before being stored on disk.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Swimlane allows full-instance snapshots that support disaster recovery and the rollback of known good application state(s).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Entries in the Swimlane credentials library, as well as user and asset passwords, are encrypted at rest before they are stored in the Swimlane database. using the AES encryption algorithm with a 256-bit key and a 256-bit salt.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="data-in-motion">Data in Motion</h3>
        <p>Swimlane protects your data in motion by using Transport Layer Security, or TLS, (versions 1.2 and 1.3) to encrypt data between the Swimlane application servers and client browsers, as well as the Swimlane database.</p>
        <h3 id="samlsso">SAML/SSO</h3>
        <p>Swimlane supports local user account provisioning, Open LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, and SAML 2.0.</p>
        <p>For more information on how Swimlane utilizes SAML, see <a href="../administrator-guide/settings/sessions-and-security/enable-saml-for-sso.htm">Enable SAML for SSO</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
        <p>Two-Factor Authentication, or 2FA, is enforced globally. All users are required to set up their individual 2FA prior to being able to access Swimlane Cloud.</p>
        <p>For more information on 2FA and Swimlane, see <a href="../administrator-guide/settings/sessions-and-security/enable-two-factor-authentication.htm">Enable Two-Factor Authentication</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="role-based-access-control">Role-Based Access Control</h3>
        <p>Swimlane limits access to information by using Role-Based Access Control, or RBAC. RBAC can be applied at every level of objects within Swimlane: workspaces, dashboards, reports, applications, records and individual records. Granular controls can be applied down to the individual field level, and all components support the ability to restrict access via user, group or role.</p>
        <p>Swimlane can dynamically adjust permissions on a per-record basis based on user/group field values, as well. For example, if a record is assigned to Group A, only Group A and administrators will have access to that record. If the assignment of the record changes to Group B, then only Group B and administrators will have access to the records.</p>
        <p>For more information about RBAC, see <a href="../administrator-guide/permissions/role-permissions.htm">Role Permissions</a> and the other permissions topics within the Administrator Guide.</p>
        <h3 id="access-to-swimlane-cloud">Access to Swimlane Cloud</h3>
        <p>Swimlane restricts access to production systems to a handful of employees. No contractors or third parties have access to any customer production data. The list of employees with access to production is audited regularly.</p>
        <h3 id="reporting-security-vulnerabilities">Reporting Security Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>Swimlane welcomes reports from security researchers and experts about possible security vulnerabilities in our product. To report a security vulnerability in Swimlane, please send details to security@swimlane.com. Swimlane does not have a bug bounty program.</p>
