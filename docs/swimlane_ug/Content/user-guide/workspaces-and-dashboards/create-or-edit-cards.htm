        <h1 id="create-or-edit-cards">Create or Edit Cards</h1>
        <p>Cards display reports, usage statistics, or HTML. Cards are completely customizable and can be resized and rearranged on dashboards by administrators and users with proper access.</p>
        <p>Click within a card to view a report that lists the records associated with that card, or click on a data point within a chart to view a filtered list of records corresponding to that data. A variety of chart types is available to display record information in meaningful ways, making dashboards powerful tools to find records quickly.</p>
