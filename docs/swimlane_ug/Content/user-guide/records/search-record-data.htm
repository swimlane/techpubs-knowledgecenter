        <p>Use Swimlane's search feature to find specific text-based data or keywords within records.</p>
        <p>Search runs over the current workspace in Swimlane. To access search, click the search icon on the workspace taskbar.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/search-button.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Filter your search by the applications assigned to the current workspace. You select or deselect applications to further filter the search.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Swimlane utilizes text-indexed search queries based on MongoDB text search. The search logic is not case-specific. Search runs over text fields, but not over numeric or date fields.</p>
        <p>To search for exact phrases or keywords, enclose the phrase or keyword in quotes, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The IP address, <code>"216.3.128.12"</code></li>
            <li>Tracking ID, <code>"ABH-3549"</code></li>
            <li><code>"New Mexico"</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exclude a word from the keyword search, prepend the word with the hyphen "-" character. For example, if you want to find records that contain the word "new" but not "New" as in "New York," you can search for <code>new -york</code>.</p>
        <p>Most punctuation that you might use in your search is treated as a delimiter. For example, searching for google.com will return results for both "google" and "com", because the period is treated as a delimiter. To search for an exact character sequence, enclose the keyword in quotes.</p>
        <p>The search results are displayed as matches, with the most relevant match listed first in the window.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/search-total-matches.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Click the tracking ID of the record to open it.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Although search runs over Comments fields, be aware that the search window does not display the Comments field in the search results window. You will need to open the record to view the contents of the field.</p>
        <p>The search window is adjustable. You can can manually resize and minimize the window. If you click on a record to view it, the search window automatically minimizes. The blue dot next to the search icon in the navigation menu indicates that a search is still open. Click the search icon again to reopen the search. To start a new search, delete the search criteria and search again.</p>
        <h2>Build Filters in Record Search Queries</h2>
        <p>You can use both AND&#160;and ANY&#160;filters in a single filter now. This boosts the capacity and strength of your search capabilities. Here's an example of a query that contains multiple filters:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/built-out-filters.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To build filters in record search queries:<br></br></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Access the records you want to search by opening a report. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click within the Search field, and then select the start of your nested search filter. You can select either ALL&#160;of the conditions to be met, or ANY&#160;of the conditions to be met. <br></br><img src="../../Resources/Images/if-all.png"></img><br></br><img src="../../Resources/Images/if-any.png"></img><br></br>Next, you create your first condition. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Continue to build your logic. In this example, the search is filtering for a specific IP&#160;address, and is also looking for any IP&#160;addresses marked "Malicious."&#160;<br></br><img src="../../Resources/Images/ip-malicious.png"></img></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can continue to build your search filter with criteria available within the application. The criteria can get as complex as you need it to be. You can filter on multiple fields and multiple values. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you would like to save your filter to use again, click the blue checkmark in the search field. Your filter will be associated with the report when you access it again. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
