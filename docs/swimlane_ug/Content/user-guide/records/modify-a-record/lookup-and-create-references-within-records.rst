Lookup and Create References within Records
===========================================

You can select which field(s) to reference from within a record. A
reference field on a record, whether single-select, multi-select, or
grid, is accompanied by a New and Lookup button adjacent to the
reference field.

For more information about reference fields in general, see
`Reference <../../../administrator-guide/applications-and-applets/application-builder/select-fields/reference.htm>`__.

Swimlane global record searches. For more information, see `Search
