        <p>During a single editing session, you can reconcile the changes you are making locally to those being updated from the server from a playbook run. If there is a conflict of data, the Manage Server Conflicts dialog opens.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/manage_server_conflicts.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The Manage Server Conflicts dialog lists the affected field, and the values from your local record edits and the values updated from the server. Select the column of the value(s) you want to save to the record and then click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
        <p>To keep your changes and continue to edit the record, select and apply <strong>Use my values</strong>. You will not be notified of additional updates to the record on the server until after you save the record.</p>
        <p>To accept the unsaved record update from the server, select and apply <strong>Use server values</strong>. Your local changes will be overwritten by the data from the server.</p>
        <p>This dialog can appear frequently when you are editing records belonging to a Swimlane application containing Trigger Integration workflow actions where the option, Automatic Execution, is set to <em>True.</em></p>
        <p>You are also likely to receive this dialog when working with applications with workflow Set Field Value actions, because in both of these examples, workflow is changing the record both in the workflow and in the application.</p>
