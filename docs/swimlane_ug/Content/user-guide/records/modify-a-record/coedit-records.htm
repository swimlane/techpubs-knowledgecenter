        <p>Multiple users can edit a record simultaneously. When you access a record that someone else is also accessing, you will see their user avatar immediately following the tracking ID of the record.</p>

        <p>As fields are modified, you will also receive immediate notification below the modified field that data has changed, along with an alert of who is making the changes.</p>

        <p>If you do not want other users to modify a record while you edit it, you can set a lock on the record. See <a href="lock-records.htm">Record Lock</a> for more information.</p>
