        <p>You can restrict view access for a single record to specific users or groups. By default, anyone with read permissions to the application's records can view all records. To restrict records:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the record you want to restrict access to.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the record header, access the record menu and select <strong>Restrict Record.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select any combination of users or groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/restrict_record.png" alt="" />
                </p>
                <p>Only individuals that fall within this selection will be able to access the record. Don't forget to add yourself or your user group!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <strong>Add</strong> for each user or group, and confirm your choices in the subsequent list.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you're finished with your list of users and groups who can view the record, click the check mark to save your choices.</p>
