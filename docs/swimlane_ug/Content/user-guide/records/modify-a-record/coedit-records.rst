Coedit Records
==============

Multiple users can edit a record simultaneously. When you access a
record that someone else is also accessing, you will see their user
avatar immediately following the tracking ID of the record.

As fields are modified, you will also receive immediate notification
below the modified field that data has changed, along with an alert of
who is making the changes.

If you do not want other users to modify a record while you edit it, you
can set a lock on the record. See `Record Lock <lock-records.htm>`__ for
more information.
