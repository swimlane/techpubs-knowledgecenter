        <p>You can share a record with others.</p>
        <p>To share a record:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the record in Swimlane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that you are in the old view of the record.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You may have switched to the enhanced view of records, but sharing a record has to be done in the old view, which is still accessible. With the record open, click <strong>Return to old view</strong> at the bottom of your screen.</p>
