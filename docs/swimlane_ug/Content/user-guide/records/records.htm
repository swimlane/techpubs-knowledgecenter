        <h1 id="records">Application Records</h1>
        <p>Records are the data from your Swimlane applications. They are made up of various fields which are customizable, configurable, and built within Swimlane's Application Builder.</p>
        <p>The fields and options available in the record vary based upon how the application is configured. Swimlane administrators control tasks related to records for administrators and users, and can grant additional access to users at the application, record, and field level. The listing of records in Swimlane are considered Reports.</p>
        <p>First, configure your workspace and dashboard to display records from applications that you access frequently. You can then access them from Swimlane's navigation bar.</p>
        <p>To access records click the Application Records icon on the navigation bar.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Use the search filter on the Application Records menu to find a specific application, as needed. The search filter will appear if you have more than 6 applications associated to your workspace.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't see the application that you expect to be listed in the navigation bar, verify that you have opened the correct workspace and dashboard and have the proper permissions to view those records. Additionally, you might need to load a different workspace.</p>
        <p>When you select the name of the application, the Default Report view of records opens.</p>
        <p>If you have multiple users accessing records of a specific application, utilize the refresh button at the bottom left of the Default Report view.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Within records, you manage and interact with data contained within the platform, and you can perform the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a New Record</li>
            <li>Modify an Existing Record</li>
            <li>Delete a Record</li>
            <li>Restrict Access to a Record</li>
            <li>Modify Bulk Records</li>
            <li>Delete Bulk Records</li>
            <li>View Record History</li>
            <li>Share, Print or Export Records</li>
        </ul>
