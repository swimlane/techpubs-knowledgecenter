        <p>Click a record to open the record. You make updates to the record and save, and then you interact with another record.</p>
        <p>When you have changes that you want to apply to multiple records, you can bulk modify data for 2 or more records.</p>
        <p>You can use the filters and keywords in the Default Report taskbar when searching for and selecting records for bulk modification.</p>
        <p>You can both modify and delete records in bulk.</p>
