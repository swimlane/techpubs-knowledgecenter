Share Reports by Schedule
=========================

On the report page, access the ellipsis drop-down menu and select
**Schedule** to access the Schedule Report page.

This feature allows you to schedule when an email of the report is sent
to recipients. In addition to scheduling the email, you can also choose
to send the email now and choose to download a preview of the report.

To schedule a report:

#. On **Schedule Report**, go to **Schedule Settings**. Select either
   **Recurring** or **One Time** for the frequency of reports being
   sent. For **Recurring**, select how often you would like the report
   to send. This can be scheduled daily, weekly, or monthly at a
   specified time. For **One Time**, select the day and time you would
   like the schedule to send.

#. Toggle **Schedule Disabled** to enable the schedule. If the schedule
   is not enabled, it will not send.

   visible in the Report Preview once you click out of the **Notes**
   text box.

5. Under **Recipients**, search for and select the name of the Swimlane
   users or groups you would like to add or enter an email address and
   then select **Add Value**.

6. Under **Report Controls**, you can chose to include a link to the
   report in Swimlane, to include the report table as a CSV file
   attachment, to include a report table, and select the page
   orientation of the report.

   This is where you format the header and footer for your report.
