        <p>On the report page, access the ellipsis drop-down menu and select <strong>Email</strong> to access the Email report page.</p>
        <p>This feature allows you to email your report to recipients. Unlike Schedule Reports, the emails sent via Email Report are sent automatically and cannot be scheduled to send at a later time. The email will only be sent one time.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Once in <strong>Email Report</strong>, under <strong>Name</strong>, type a name for your report. This name is visible in the Report Preview once you click out of the <strong>Name</strong> text box.</li>
            <p>The name is the subject line of the email.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Under <strong>Notes</strong>, type any notes you would like to include on the report. These notes are visible in the Report Preview once you click out of the <strong>Notes</strong> text box.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Notes display as the body of the email.</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Under <strong>Recipients</strong>, search for and select the name of the Swimlane users or groups you would like to add.</li>
            <p>The recipients that display in this field are other Swimlane users that have role-based access to the report. Select from those users. Know that you can also manually enter email address for people who are not Swimlane users.</p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Name and Recipients are required to send your report.</p>

        <ol start="4">
            <li>Under <strong>Report Controls</strong>, you can chose to include a link to the report in Swimlane, to include the report table as a CSV file attachment, to include a report table, and select the page orientation of the report.</li>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When including a report table, the table displays a maximum of 25 records. If the report contains more than 25 records, you receive a message at the bottom of the report table that indicates how many total records are included.</p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong><b>Unavailable Report Controls</b> appears if there is a report containing a widget, or if the report does not contain a chart. This lets you know that the report will be including the report table since widgets are not supported in shared reports and the chart cannot be displayed.</p>

            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Email and PDF settings can be configured in <strong>Settings</strong> under <strong>Email and PDF Settings</strong>.</p>
