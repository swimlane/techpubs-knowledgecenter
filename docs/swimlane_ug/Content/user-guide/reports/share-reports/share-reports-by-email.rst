Share Reports by Email
======================

On the report page, access the ellipsis drop-down menu and select
**Email** to access the Email report page.

This feature allows you to email your report to recipients. Unlike
Schedule Reports, the emails sent via Email Report are sent
automatically and cannot be scheduled to send at a later time. The email
will only be sent one time.

#. Once in **Email Report**, under **Name**, type a name for your
   report. This name is visible in the Report Preview once you click out
   of the **Name** text box.

2. Under **Notes**, type any notes you would like to include on the
   report. These notes are visible in the Report Preview once you click
   out of the **Notes** text box.

Notes display as the body of the email.

3. Under **Recipients**, search for and select the name of the Swimlane
   users or groups you would like to add.

4. Under **Report Controls**, you can chose to include a link to the
   report in Swimlane, to include the report table as a CSV file
   attachment, to include a report table, and select the page
   orientation of the report.

5. Click the drop-down arrow next to **Header and Footer Formatting**.
   This is where you format the header and footer for your report.

6. Once you have finished editing your report, click **Send Now**. A
   dialog appears confirming the email will be sent momentarily. Once
   the report is sent, click **Close** to exit.
