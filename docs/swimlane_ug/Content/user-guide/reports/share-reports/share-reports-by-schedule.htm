        <p>On the report page, access the ellipsis drop-down menu and select <strong>Schedule</strong> to access the Schedule Report page.</p>
        <p>This feature allows you to schedule when an email of the report is sent to recipients. In addition to scheduling the email, you can also choose to send the email now and choose to download a preview of the report.</p>
        <p>To schedule a report:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On <strong>Schedule Report</strong>, go to <strong>Schedule Settings</strong>. Select either <strong>Recurring</strong> or <strong>One Time</strong> for the frequency of reports being sent. For <strong>Recurring</strong>, select how often you would like the report to send. This can be scheduled daily, weekly, or monthly at a specified time. For <strong>One Time</strong>, select the day and time you would like the schedule to send.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Toggle <strong>Schedule Disabled</strong> to enable the schedule. If the schedule is not enabled, it will not send.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Under <strong>Report Details</strong>, under <strong>Name</strong>, type a name for the report. This name is visible in the Report Preview once you click out of the <strong>Name</strong> text box.</p>
            </li>
            <p>The name is the subject line of the email.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Under <strong>Notes</strong>, type notes to include in the report. These notes are visible in the Report Preview once you click out of the <strong>Notes</strong> text box.</li>
            <p>Notes display as the body of the email.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>Under <strong>Recipients</strong>, search for and select the name of the Swimlane users or groups you would like to add or enter an email address and then select <strong>Add Value</strong>.</li>
            <p>The recipients that display in this field are other Swimlane users that have role-based access to the report. Select from those usernames. Know that you can also manually enter email address for people outside of Swimlane users.</p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Users who have previously been added to scheduled reports will continue to have access. You should edit the schedule to include them; use their email addresses instead of their username and the scheduled report will continue to be delivered.</p>

            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Name and Recipients fields are required to send your report.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>Under <strong>Report Controls</strong>, you can chose to include a link to the report in Swimlane, to include the report table as a CSV file attachment, to include a report table, and select the page orientation of the report.</li>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When including a report table, the table displays a maximum of 25 records. If the report contains more than 25 records, you receive a message at the bottom of the report table that indicates how many total records are included.</p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><strong>Unavailable Report Controls</strong> appearsif there is a report containing a widget, or if the report does not contain a chart. This lets you know that the report will be including the report table since widgets are not supported in shared reports and the chart cannot be displayed.</p>

        </ol>
        <ol start="7">
            <li>Click the drop-down arrow next to <strong>Header and Footer Formatting</strong>. This is where you format the header and footer for your report.</li>

            </p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The header and footer can be customized using the available editor. To make more advanced changes to the layout, you can access and edit the raw HTML of the header and footer by opening the source code tool from the editor's toolbar.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="8">
            <li>Once you have finished editing your report, click <strong>Save Schedule</strong>. A dialog appears confirming the email has been scheduled. Once the schedule is saved, click <strong>Close</strong> to exit.</li>
            <p>To view all scheduled reports, click the ellipsis on the report header and select <strong>Details and Schedules</strong>.</p>
            <p>Your email shows the name of the account the email is sent from, the name of the report, the notes included in the report, a link to the report in Swimlane if selected, a PDF of the report, and a CSV file of the report table if selected.</p>
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can configure the mail and PDF default settings in <strong>Settings</strong> under <strong>Email and PDF Settings</strong>. Changes made to the PDF default settings will show in scheduled reports that have not had the header or footer edited. Scheduled reports that have been edited will not reflect these changes in the PDF default settings.</p>
