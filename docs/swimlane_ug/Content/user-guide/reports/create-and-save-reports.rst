Create and Save Reports
=======================

The filters and records you view on the Default Report page can be saved
as reports. Add reports to a dashboard for quick access to analytics.

users.

will be able to edit and save existing reports if you have modify
permissions for reports. You will be able to create, edit, and save
reports if you have create permissions for reports.

filtering see, `Keyword Search and
Filter <keyword-search-and-filter.htm>`__.

Save a Default View of Records
------------------------------

When you first create a series of records, the view of the Records page
lists all the records created so far. This is the Default Report of your
records. You can change this default view.

To save a default view of records:

#. Use filters and column view settings to customize the view according
   to your preferences.

#. From the Default Report taskbar, select **Save Report As.**

#. On Save Report As, select *Existing Report* from the **Save As**
   drop-down field.

Swimlane displays all of the existing reports related to your
application.

4. Under Existing Reports, select *Default*.

Report Widgets
--------------

You can set up report widgets from within Charts. From the Default
Report records view, click **Charts,** then from Chart Options, select
**Widgets.**

Report widgets have access to the report's data, in two different
formats: raw (as it is received from the API), and a more user friendly
format where the ID's are replaced with values. In addition to the
report's data, the widget also has access to the query.

For more detail on setting up report widgets, see `Report
Widgets <../../administrator-guide/widgets/report-widgets.htm>`__ in the
Swimlane Developer Guide.
