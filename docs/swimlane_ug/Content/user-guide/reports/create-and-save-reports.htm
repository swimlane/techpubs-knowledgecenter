        <p>The filters and records you view on the Default Report page can be saved as reports. Add reports to a dashboard for quick access to analytics. Report permissions allow you to share the reports you create with other users.</p>
        <p>To save edits to an existing a report, from the Report taskbar, click the ellipsis menu icon and select <strong>Save Report</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/save-report.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>You'll receive a notification in the bottom right corner upon saving.</p>
        <p>+&gt; <strong>Note:</strong> Your ability to modify reports depends on permissions! You will be able to edit and save existing reports if you have modify permissions for reports. You will be able to create, edit, and save reports if you have create permissions for reports.</p>
        <p>+&gt; <strong>Note:</strong> For more information on using keywords searches and filtering see, <a href="keyword-search-and-filter.htm" target="_blank">Keyword Search and Filter</a>.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Use filters and column view settings to customize the view according to your preferences.</p>

        <h2 id="report-widgets">Report Widgets</h2>
        <p>You can set up report widgets from within Charts. From the Default Report records view, click <strong>Charts,</strong> then from Chart Options, select <strong>Widgets.</strong></p>
        <p>Report widgets have access to the report's data, in two different formats:  raw (as it is received from the API), and a more user friendly format where the ID's are replaced with values. In addition to the report's data, the widget also has access to the query.</p>
        <p>For more detail on setting up report widgets, see <a href="../../administrator-guide/widgets/report-widgets.htm">Report Widgets</a> in the Swimlane Developer Guide.</p>
