Reports
=======

Reports are collections of records collected from a Swimlane
application. These reports can be customized through keyword searching
and filtering and then saved to show the selected information. These
saved reports can also be shared with other users. The topics in this
section provide information on how to create, filter, and share reports
within Swimlane.
