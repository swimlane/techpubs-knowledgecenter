        <h1 id="measures-and-dimensions">Measures and Dimensions</h1>
        <p>Every chart has a number of measures and dimensions that can be visualized. The number of dimensions and measures needed for the chart is indicated by a status message in the chart preview section.</p>
        <p>The measures and dimensions on the chart are configured through the Query tab in the chart configuration section. All of the available fields that can be selected as a measure or a dimension are listed in the left side of the query section. The right side shows the currently-selected measures and dimensions.</p>
        <h2 id="measures">Measures</h2>
        <p>To add a measure to the query, either click the <strong>+</strong> button to the right of the measure in the Measures list, or drag and drop the measure into the marked placeholder under <strong>Edit Measures.</strong> To remove a measure from the query, click the <strong>x</strong> button to the right of the measure in the <strong>Edit Measures</strong> list.</p>
        <p>Measures have an aggregate function that is used to calculate the numeric value of the data item. This function must return a number. All fields except numeric fields have one available aggregate function, Count of. Numeric fields also have Sum of, Average of, and Min of options.</p>
        <p>To change the aggregate function for a measure, click on the measure and select the desired function from the dropdown.</p>

To change the function, click on the dimension and then re-select the desired function from the dropdown.</p>
