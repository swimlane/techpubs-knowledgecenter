Hovering over individual data items in the chart visualization will
highlight them and display a tooltip with additional details. Clicking
the item will create a filter for the dimension and measure values it
represents. The filter will immediately appear in the filter bar, and
also apply itself to the record list in the records data table on the
bottom of the page.
