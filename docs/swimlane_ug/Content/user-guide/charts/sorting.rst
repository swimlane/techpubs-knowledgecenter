Sorting
=======

The order that the data items display in the chart can be changed
through the Sorting tab on the chart configuration panel. By default,
all dimensions are sorted by *Label* in ascending order.

To change the order of a dimension, click the dropdown showing the
current order for the dimension and select the desired order.

-  By label - ascending / descending
-  By value - ascending / descending
-  Custom

The custom sorting option allows your data to be ordered manually.
Select *Custom* to display all the selected data in a list below the
dropdown. You can then reorder any of the data by dragging and dropping
them wherever you want.
