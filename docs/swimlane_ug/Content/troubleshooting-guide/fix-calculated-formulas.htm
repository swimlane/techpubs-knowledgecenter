        <p>If your Swimlane instance throws 500 errors when you click on records or when you try to open an application, you might pull errors similar to this:</p>

        <p>More than likely, this error means you have calculated fields that are not failing because they aren't accounting for empty fields.</p>
        <p>For example, you have a calculated field, <strong>Case TT Resolved Min</strong> whose calculations depend on <strong>Case Created On</strong> and <strong>Case Closed On</strong> fields. You will get an error if those two files are not populated correctly.</p>
        <p>Chances are these fields are using a formula similar to the following:</p>
        <p><code>IF ([Case Created On] = [Case Resolved On], 0, TOTALMINUTES([Case Created On],[Case Resolved On]))</code>
        </p>
        <p>Notice that this formula is only checking if two fields are equal in order to skip the calculation and return <em>0</em>. However, it is not checking whether <strong>Case Created On</strong> or <strong>Case Resolved On</strong> fields are empty. The fact that these fields are indeed empty is likely causing the issue.</p>
        <p>To confirm if this is the issue, open the problematic record(s) and check if all the fields are populated. If they are not, you have found the problem!</p>
        <p>To fix this issue:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From the Swimlane global navigation menu, select Applications &amp; Applets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the application or applet that is causing the error.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the fields in the Form Layout and select Edit to open the Calculation Builder:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Change the formula by adding “OR” and “IsBlank" to allow for the empty fields, for example:</p>
                <MadCap:codeSnippet>
                    <codeSnippetCopyButton />
                    <codeSnippetBody>IF (OR([Case Created On] = [Case Closed On], IsBlank([Case Created On]), IsBlank([Case Closed On])), 0, TOTALMINUTES([Case Created On],[Case Closed On]))
</codeSnippetBody>
                </MadCap:codeSnippet>
            </li>
        </ol>
