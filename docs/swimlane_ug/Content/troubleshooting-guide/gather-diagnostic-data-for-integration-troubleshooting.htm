        <p>When you need to contact Swimlane support for assistance, you should include diagnostic data. This topic instructs you how to find preliminary data for troubleshooting integration failures.</p>
        <p>Before you begin, jot down your answers to the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Are all the integrations failing? Or is it just one, or just a few that are failing?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What type of integrations are failing? Is it a Python script, a forked task, or a plugin task?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If it is a plugin task, take note of the plugin name, version, and the name of the task that is being used.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What failure errors are you getting when the integration fails? (Include screenshots of any errors in the UI if possible.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, check the most recent logs from Swimlane logging.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To gather diagnostic data for integration troubleshooting:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In Swimlane, replicate the issue and capture a HAR file:</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you need information on how to capture a HAR file, see these <a href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/">instructions</a>.</p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Navigate to Background Jobs, which opens Hangfire.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/background_jobs_settings.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Take screenshots of the most recent jobs from the Hangfire Deleted queue and provide the full stack trace of the error.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/jobs_deleted.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Connect to MongoDB. Run the following query to find additional diagnostic information for the most-recently encountered errors:</p>
                <p><code>db.Logs.find({Level:'Error'}).sort({Date:-1}).limit(30).pretty()</code>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
