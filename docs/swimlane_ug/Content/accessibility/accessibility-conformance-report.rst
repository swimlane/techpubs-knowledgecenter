Accessibility Conformance Report
================================

**Based on VPAT® Revision 2.4**

-  **Name of Product/Version:** Swimlane 10.13.2
-  **Report Date:** July 2023
-  **Product Description:** Swimlane is a security orchestration and
   automation platform. With Swimlane you can prioritize alerts,
   remediate threats and improve your operational performance.
-  **Contact Information:** info@swimlane.com

**Note:** Swimlane is a web-only application.

**Evaluation Methods Used:**

Swimlane is committed to providing an exceptional user experience to all
people. As part of that commitment, we aim to ensure the convenience of
our product is accessible to each person who wishes to use it by
designing and building our product to be consistent with the
accessibility guidelines and principles per the Section 508 Amendment to
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as well as WCAG Level 2.0/2.1 Level A
standards.

As part of this commitment, we utilize both manual and automated
assessment techniques to determine any areas for improvement. By
implementing these assessments into our development pipeline, we aim to
ensure that any issues that may cause accessibility issues within the
Swimlane platform are appropriately prioritized and addressed as we
continue to develop new experiences.

Manual assessment techniques using native `Google Chrome® browser
development tools <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/>`__ and
automated scans from `Accessibility
Insights <https://accessibilityinsights.io/>`__ are employed to test
Swimlane.
