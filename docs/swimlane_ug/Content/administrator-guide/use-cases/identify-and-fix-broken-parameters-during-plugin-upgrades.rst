Identify and Fix Broken Parameters During Plugin Upgrades
=========================================================

   .. rubric:: Scenario
      :name: scenario

   Alex has a working plugin, but she is ready to upgrade it.
   Previously, plugins had a narrow scope of data for inputs and
   outputs. This meant Alex had to rely on Swimlane customer support to
   identify and provide enhancements, so that the plugin would not
   break. The narrow scope meant Alex lost time contacting customer
   support and waiting for assistance.

   Now Alex wants to resolve input and output parameter breaks in plugin
   upgrades by having the application alert her to inputs and outputs
   that will break post-upgrade. Alex has taken the step to upgrade the
   plugin and she is ready to resolve tasks that will break as a result
   of the upgrade.
