        <h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Chris works in a Security Operations Center (SOC). He is responsible for discovering and reporting malicious URLs. He has a list of URLs that are reported to him each morning. He looks up each of the URLs in the list with VirusTotal. He then uses the resulting VirusTotal scans to report which URLs are most severe. This takes up most of Chris's morning each work day.</p>
            <p>Chris would like to use Swimlane to simplify and automate this process. He has already ensured that his version of Swimlane has a VirusTotal integration. He has also reviewed the VirusTotal report to determine which data he will want to use to feed his Swimlane application(s) and workflow.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
        <p>Chris can resolve this scenario with the following solution:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Build an application in Swimlane that includes a Reference field. The application should also include a Selection field that can handle multiple values.</li>
            <p>Chris created the <em>Incidents</em> application, and included a reference field, VirusTotal Results. He created the <strong>Severity</strong> multi-select Selection field and set up Low, Normal, High, and Critical with the Values List Editor.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/incidents-app.png" alt="" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>With the reference field selected, create a new application to reference.</li>
            <p>Chris selected <strong>VirusTotal Results</strong> and then clicked <strong>Create New Application to Reference.</strong></p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/create-new-app-to-reference.png" alt="" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Create the application to reference from the <em>Incidents</em> application. Include the fields you will use as targets when setting up task output mapping.</li>
            <p>Chris created two fields: a URL field and a field to hold the VirusTotal data for "Positives," which is the VirusTotal data field that reports the # of malicious files associated to a URL. He named the new application <em>VirusTotal Results</em> and saved the application.</p>

</codeSnippetBody>
            </MadCap:codeSnippet>
        </ol>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Back in the original <em>Incidents</em> application, notice how the secondary application, <em>VirusTotal Results</em> is now selected in the Reference Application field. Next, select the fields to reference.</li>
            <p>Chris clicked <strong>Select Fields to Display</strong> and selected <strong>URL</strong> and <strong>Positives,</strong> from the field selection dialog.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/field-selection-dialog.png" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>The selected fields now display within the <em>Incidents</em> VirusTotal Results field properties.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/reference-field-properties.png" alt="" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>Next, you'll create a VirusTotal task, and map to the <em>VirusTotal Results</em> fields.</li>
            <p>Chris created the task, <em>VT URL Report,</em> and defined the asset, VirusTotal. He set up the input on the Configuration tab.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/vt-url-report-input.png" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>He then created output mappings to the URL and Positives fields.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/vt-positives-url-mappings.png" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>He also enabled Swimlane to add reference data back to the original, parent record: the VirusTotal Results reference field.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/add-reference-vtresults.png" alt="" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>Now that the integration task and the applications are set up, create the workflow that will automate the URL lookup and reporting processes.</li>
            <p>Chris reopened the <em>Incidents</em> application and created workflow there since it is the original or parent application for this process. He created a condition that holds the URL list field, and a repeat that will iterate over each item in the URL field.</p>
            <p>He then created an action that creates a trigger to run a VirusTotal scan over the URL.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/vt-integration-wf-setup.png" alt="" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="7">
            <li>The VirusTotal integration task returns a value to the Positives field. Create a new workflow condition that points to the target field in order to process the action.</li>
            <p>Chris specified that the target field for the VirusTotal Results field is Positives.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/indicate-positives.png" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>He also specified that any value greater than 7 should trigger a change of <strong>Severity</strong> to <em>Critical.</em></p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/set-severity-critical.png" alt="" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="8">
            <li>Finish the workflow by setting up additional stages and actions for each value for the <strong>Severity</strong> field, then click <strong>OK.</strong></li>
            <p>Here is a look at the complete workflow that Chris created:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/incidents-workflow.png" alt="" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Chris can now start his day knowing that he has automated the process of searching for and reporting malicious URLs.</p>
