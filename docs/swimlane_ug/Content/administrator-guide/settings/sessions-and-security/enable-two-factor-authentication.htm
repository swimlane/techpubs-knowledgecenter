        <h1 id="enable-two-factor-authentication">Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h1>
        <p>Two-Factor Authentication, or 2FA, adds an additional layer of security to Swimlane user accounts. Each time users sign in, they will need a password and a verification code.</p>
        <p>You can enforce 2FA across your organization. Users will then be required to set up 2FA and will not be able to disable the setting.</p>
        <p>If you choose not to enforce 2FA globally, then individual users will be able to enable setting up 2FA.</p>
        <h2 id="globally-enabling-two-factor-authentication">Globally Enabling Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
        <p>To globally enable two-factor authentication:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From the Sessions and Security dashboard, click <strong>&gt;</strong> to expand <strong>Authentication.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>Toggle <strong>Enforced across your organization</strong> to turn on 2FA for everyone accessing Swimlane from your organization.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/2fa-enforce.png" alt="" /></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="enabling-two-factor-authentication-as-an-individual-user">Enabling Two-Factor Authentication as an Individual User</h2>
        <p>Users can enable two-factor authentication for themselves. Administrators cannot individually assign 2FA to a subset of users.</p>
        <p>Instruct users to set up their individual 2FA credentials using the following steps.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Users who encounter the log in screen of a globally enabled 2FA organization will access the <em>Enable Two-Factor Authentication</em> window upon attempting to log in to Swimlane. Users who want to enable 2FA individually will need to follow steps 1 - 3, below.</p>
        <p>To enable two-factor authentication as an individual user:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If you have administrator access, from the global navigation menu, hover over the <strong>Users, Groups, and Roles</strong> icon, then select <strong>Users</strong>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Users page, locate your user account and open it.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively, you can access your Profile Options from the upper right corner of the Swimlane UI.</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>On User Profile, click the Authentication tab, then click <strong>Enable 2FA.</strong></li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/2fa-setup.png" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>Follow the steps on the Enable Two-Factor Authentication window.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="additional-administrator-actions-for-2fa">Additional Administrator Actions for 2FA</h2>
        <p>Administrators can reset the 2FA setup for users as needed. To reset a user's individually-set 2FA account, log in and access the User page. Open the user's profile page, and select the Authentication tab. Click <strong>Reset.</strong></p>
        <p>The user will be prompted to set up a new instance of 2FA for Swimlane once they attempt to log in again.</p>
        <p>Administrators can also exempt specific users from having to use 2FA. To do this, access the specific user, and then toggle the <strong>Exempt</strong> switch on the User Profile Authentication window.</p>
