Swimlane Solution Packages
==========================

Swimlane solution packages (.ssp) contain at least one application or
applet, along with all of the associated applications, tasks, assets,
plugins, workflows, reports, dashboards, and workspaces that form a
complete solution. The key thing to remember is that all of the pieces
of the solution are available within the package.

**Important!** Swimlane solution packages are available in Swimlane
platform version 10.4.0 and forward.
