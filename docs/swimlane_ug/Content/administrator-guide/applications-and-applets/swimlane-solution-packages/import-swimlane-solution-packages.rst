Import Swimlane Solution Packages
=================================

You import Swimlane solution packages (.ssp) into a Swimlane system. The
packages contain at least one application or applet, along with all of
the associated applications, tasks, assets, plugins, workflows, reports,
dashboards, and workspaces that form a complete solution.

The import process handles some issues for you, either stepping you
through the process or letting you know that there will be actions that
will need to be taken once the import is finished. The process also
alerts you of critical errors that you need to be aware of.

**Important!** You cannot import the same content twice in a Swimlane
solution package. Swimlane does not currently support content conflict
resolution, although it is planned for a future release.

You can upgrade plugins as part of the import process. The process will
notify you if there is a newer version of a plugin you are importing.

In order for your imported solution to be fully functional, you may need
to address all of the issues Swimlane points out during the import
process.

**Note:** Exporting and importing Swimlane solution packages can only be
done by Swimlane System Administrators.

To import Swimlane solution packages:

#. From the Applications and Applets main page taskbar, click the plus
   menu icon and then select **Import applications and applets**.

   You are prompted to drag and drop the file to the Swimlane window, or
   you can browse locally for the file and select it for upload.

#. At this point, Swimlane checks for errors and issues in the imported
   data.
