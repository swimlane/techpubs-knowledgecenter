Applications and Applets
========================

Applications and Applets are the foundation of the Swimlane platform.

**What is an application?**

A user-defined template for collecting, storing, and organizing your
data. All automated activities and decisions are driven by how your
application stores data. You also manage workflow from within
applications.

**What is an applet?**

A preconfigured set of fields and layout specifications. Applets are
appended to an existing application form layout and allow users to
easily update and expand their existing applications.
