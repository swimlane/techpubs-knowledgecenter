        <h1 id="define-the-foundation">Define the Foundation</h1>
        <p>You create a new application from the Applications and Applets home page. During the process of creating an application, you are prompted to define its foundational details.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From the Applications and Applets home page task bar, click the plus menu icon, and then select <strong>Create an application.</strong></p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Create Application dialog opens, to the General tab. Name your application, and optionally provide a description.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Swimlane automatically assigns an acronym to your application, according to the name that you provided. During this step you can override the automatic assignment by typing in the field instead. <strong>Acronym</strong> is a four-character field.</p>
                <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Once you create an application you cannot change the acronym.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <strong>Enable tracking time</strong> to allow time tracking on records.</p>
            </li>
            <p>When you track time on records, action on records will generate a hidden field, <em>Total Time Spent,</em> which can be used to generate reports and charts. You can enable and disable time tracking at any time for any application. Enabled time tracking also enables a dialog that displays the amount of time you've worked on a record upon saving a record.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>
                <p>Click <strong>Next,</strong> or click the <strong>Administration</strong> tab.</p>
                <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Once you click the <strong>Create</strong> button, the application is created and saved. You can edit many of the application settings again, but others are set once the application is created.</p>

            <li>
                <p>On Administration Permissions, add the roles you want to be able to access your application and then assign the role their specific actions.</p>

                <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't assign a role here, the default permissions are set to a general administrator role.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the editing action you want to enable for the role for your application, then click <strong>Next.</strong> (Alternatively, click the <strong>Records</strong> tab.)</p>

            <li>

            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Users access records from the navigation menu, Application Records. You must allow users' access to an application's records in order for them to be viewed or modified.</p>

                <p>Click <strong>Next,</strong> or click the <strong>Workspace</strong> tab.</p>

                <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can only create a workspace upon creation of an application if you have permission to do so.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, add the roles you want to have read, edit, and delete access to this application's workspace.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once you have the Workspace foundation defined, click <strong>Create.</strong> Application Builder opens.</p>
                <p>You are now ready to create the layout of your application.</p>
