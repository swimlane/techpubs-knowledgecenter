        <h1 id="select-fields-and-assign-field-properties">Select Fields and Assign Field Properties</h1>
        <p>You select fields and assign field properties as you build your application. This section covers the Application and Applet fields and the options they provide for setup on the Field Properties tab.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The fields you use to build your application are the fields that users will access when they create or edit records in Swimlane. Here's a screenshot of a new Swimlane record with multiple fields available to fill out.</p>

        <h2 id="field-keys">Field Keys</h2>
        <p>Field Keys function as aliases for fields. They allow for consistent data ingestion, product upgrades, and imports of applications across different environments.</p>
        <p>Field Keys are validated for uniqueness against other Field Keys and field Display Names within an application (they can be the same as their corresponding Display Name). They can be a maximum of 32 characters and can only contain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lower-case letters.</li>
            <li>Numbers.</li>
            <li>Hyphens.</li>
            <li>Underscores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you first create a field, Swimlane names the Field Key based on the field <strong>Display Name.</strong> Upper-case letters are converted to lower-case, spaces are replaced with dashes, and non-alphanumeric characters are removed. You can change the field key value at this time, if desired.</p>
        <p>Administrators can change field keys within Application Builder by de-selecting the lock icon. The field key value, once unlocked, can be changed. This lock allows changes to the Display Name of field to be made without affecting the field key value.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/field_keys.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>If an application is imported from an older version of Swimlane and duplicate Key Field values would be created based on the established Display Name values, integers will be added the field to prevent duplication (e.g. field, field2, etc.). If the Field Key exceeds 32 characters, it is truncated at 29 characters, with integers added to the end as needed.</p>
