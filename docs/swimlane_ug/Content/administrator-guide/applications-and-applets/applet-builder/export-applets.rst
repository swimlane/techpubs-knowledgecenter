Export Applets
==============

You can download Swimlane applets. For example, you might want to export
a specific applet in order to import it into another instance of
Swimlane.

Swimlane applet exports include:

-  All fields on the layout of the applet
-  All workflow conditions and actions
-  All reports associated with the applet
-  Workspaces and dashboards associated with the applet

Components of applets that are not included as part of the download are:

-  Cross-referenced applets (cross-referenced fields will be
   disconnected)
-  Record export templates
-  Applet history

To export an applet:

#. Load the Applications and Applets main page.

#. Find the applet that you want to export and then, from the drop-down
   menu on the applet, select **Export.**

#. The applet .json file is exported to your browser's default location.
