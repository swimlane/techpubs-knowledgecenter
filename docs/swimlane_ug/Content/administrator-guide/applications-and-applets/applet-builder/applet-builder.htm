        <h1 id="applet-builder">Applet Builder</h1>
        <p>Applet Builder is the starting point for building and managing applets. With Swimlane's Applet Builder you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and modify fields and layouts.</li>
            <li>Set field level permissions and properties.</li>
            <li>Configure calculations.</li>
            <li>Access, build, and update workflow.</li>
            <li>Run manual validations.</li>
            <li>Create export templates.</li>
            <li>View revision history.</li>
            <li>Delete applets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Applets share nearly all of the same features as applications. There are a few important differences, including the way applets handle reference fields and the way that applets configure workflow upon the addition of an applet to an application.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Users who do not have permissions set on any applications, but have global permissions set in all other areas of Swimlane, will be able to view applications and applets in the Administrator menu. If users have global permissions for applets, they will be able to edit applets. However, since they do not have any permissions set for applications, they will see applications listed, but will be unable to edit them or otherwise modify them.</p>
        <h2 id="page-components">Page Components</h2>
        <p>The Applet Builder page consists of these main components:</p>
        <table style="mc-table-style: url('../../../Resources/TableStyles/Alternate-Row-Color.css');" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color" cellspacing="21">
            <thead>
                <tr class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-Head-Header1">

                    <th style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-HeadD-Column1-Header1">Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-Body-Body1">
                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><strong>Field Types</strong>
                    </td>
                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Available fields that you use to build your applet. The fields support the various input data for the records.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-Body-Body2">
                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyE-Column1-Body2"><strong>Form Layout</strong>

                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyD-Column1-Body2">The container where you modify the arrangement of fields for your applet.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-Body-Body1">
                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><strong>Applet Settings</strong>
                    </td>
                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Settings you assign that are relevant to the entire applet, such as Name, Description, and permissions.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-Body-Body2">
                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyE-Column1-Body2"><strong>Field Properties</strong>
                    </td>
                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyD-Column1-Body2">Settings and properties that you assign for specific fields within the applet, such as permissions, size of the field in the layout, values, and whether the field is required.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-Body-Body1">
                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyB-Column1-Body1"><strong>Hidden Fields</strong>

                    <td style="text-align: left;" class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-BodyA-Column1-Body1">A list of fields that exist within the applet and are available for reports and modification in workflow, but that are not visible in the record entry form.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>You control the view of Applet Builder. Look for the small keyboard icon in the lower left corner of the applet.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/page-view-settings.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Click the keyboard icon to open a control panel that contains keyboard shortcuts for controlling the view of the applet. Adjust your view settings, and then click <strong>X</strong> to close the control panel.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/page-view-controls.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <h2 id="hidden-fields">Hidden Fields</h2>
        <p>Hidden Fields are fields that exist within the applet and are available for reports, but are not visible in the record entry form.</p>
        <p>Hidden fields are visible at the bottom of the Applet Builder form layout.</p>
        <h2 id="field-validation">Field Validation</h2>
        <p>While you build out the forms for your applet Swimlane validates the fields, looking for duplicate fields or empty fields. You will see inline checks and pop-up error notifications that contain additional detail about the error and how you can resolve it. The pop-up error notification will lead you through the process of resolving the error and will disappear once you've successfully saved the applet.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of an inline check for a duplicate field name:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/unique_field.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Here is an example of a pop-up error notification:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/nag-error-resolution.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Click the errors, and then the field(s) on the pop-up notification to edit and resolve the error(s).</p>
        <p>You can also manually run a validation. From the Applet Builder taskbar menu, select <strong>Validate.</strong></p>
