        <p>To import existing Python or Powershell scripts to Swimlane, click <strong>Upload Tasks/Scripts</strong> on the Integrations toolbar and then follow the instructions in the UI.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/uploadscriptstasks.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Next, you assign the script or task to an application, and then click Upload.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/assign-script-app.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The content of the script is then used to create a task of the same type as the script. Uploaded tasks (for example, .json files) are recreated as a task within the specified application.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Be aware that you might need to further configure the task to handle inputs and outputs after uploading.</p>
        <p>Previously exported tasks can also be uploaded.</p>
