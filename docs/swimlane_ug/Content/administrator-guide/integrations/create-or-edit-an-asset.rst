Create or Edit an Asset
=======================

Assets are reusable, structured, and product-specific objects that
contribute to the success of Swimlane tasks by handling secure
authentication and configuration specifications for external systems.

On the Integrations, **Assets** tab, you can view the assets that you
have already set up. If you can't find a specific asset, consider
looking through your uploaded plugins. You might need to upload a plugin
that has the asset type that you are looking for.

   needed.

   If the parameters you set on the asset include any API key or other
   connective details, you can test the active connection of the asset
   within Swimlane.

#. Click **Test Connection** and ensure you get the resulting "Asset
   Test Successful" message.
