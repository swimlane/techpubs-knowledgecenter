Upload Scripts and Tasks
========================

To import existing Python or Powershell scripts to Swimlane, click
**Upload Tasks/Scripts** on the Integrations toolbar and then follow the
instructions in the UI.

Next, you assign the script or task to an application, and then click
Upload.

The content of the script is then used to create a task of the same type
as the script. Uploaded tasks (for example, .json files) are recreated
as a task within the specified application.

**Note:** Be aware that you might need to further configure the task to
handle inputs and outputs after uploading.

Previously exported tasks can also be uploaded.
