        <h1 id="applets-and-tasks">Applets and Tasks</h1>
        <p>When you create a task, you can choose to leave the task as a common task or associate it with an applet or application. Applets and applications can reference any common tasks or the associated tasks. When adding an applet that contains a task or workflow to an application, Swimlane notifies you that the applet workflow is being added to the application and new application tasks will be created for each of the applet tasks.</p>

        <p>Applet tasks differ from application task in a few ways, mainly in the way applet task input and output parameters are configured. When configuring parameters in an applet task, you will see the options to map a parameter from or to a record. However, applets do not have records to map to. When the applet is added to the application, the applet tasks are duplicated as application tasks and any input or output parameters mapped to the current record are updated accordingly.</p>
        <p>Additionally, on the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, in the <strong>Debugger</strong> subtab, you can click <strong>Run Task</strong> to check your script. However, unlike application tasks, applet tasks can not be tested against a record.</p>
