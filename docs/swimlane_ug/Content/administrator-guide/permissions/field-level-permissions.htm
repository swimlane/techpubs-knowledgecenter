        <p>Field-level permissions are administered through Application Builder and are automatically inherited from Record Permissions applied at the application level.</p>
        <p>From the application settings, click Record Permissions and then select the roles you want to allow access to the application's records in <strong>Add Roles</strong>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Roles can also be given permissions to individual fields within an application. From the Application Builder, select the field from the application layout and then, in the Field Editor, go to Permissions.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Roles with read permissions will be able to view but not edit the selected field. Update permissions allow the user to edit the field. Roles with no permissions set will not be able to see the selected field on the record page.</p>
