        <p>Administrators manage Swimlane roles. To access the Roles page, from the global navigation menu, hover over the <strong>Users, Groups, and Roles</strong> icon, and then select <strong>Roles</strong>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Manage a role by clicking on the role name, or create a new role by clicking <strong>New Role</strong>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Assign the name for the role, and enter an optional description. Then assign groups and users associated to this role.</p>

        </p>
        <p>On the Permission tab, set permissions for each object by type and function. Clicking the box to the left of the name of each module  will automatically select all available functions (Create, Read, Modify, Delete). You can set role permissions here for Workspaces, Dashboards, Applications, Applets, Records, Reports, Tasks, Assets, Key Store, Plugins, and Python Packages. These granular permissions allow you to create specific, powerful roles.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If you want to set System Administrator permissions for the role, enable the System Administrator toggle. This allows all permissions for this role. Since the role now has all permissions, the module table disappears.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Select the Global option to allow the role access to all of the items within the selected module. </p>
        <p>When the "Share" permission is selected for Reports / Dashboards, user would be able to Schedule, Email and Download the Report / Dashboard.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can also restrict specific roles from viewing records and record history. On the Permissions tab, select <strong>Record</strong>. Find the record(s) you want to restrict from this role, and click the Restrict Record box. Users with that role will not be able to view the record or it's workflow history.</p>
        <p>Refer to this table for more information about how role permissions and field-level permissions work together:</p>
