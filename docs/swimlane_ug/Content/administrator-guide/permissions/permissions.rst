Permissions
===========

Swimlane uses a role-based permissions model. We designed permissions
with flexibility in mind which allows for a flexible administration of
roles, groups, users and their permissions. This also allows for
synchronization between Swimlane and customer systems like LDAP and
Active Directory.

Administrators can set permissions for:

-  **Roles:** Functional roles associated with users and groups that
   hold permissions to objects.
-  **Users:** Users defined in Swimlane or imported to Swimlane from
   Active Directory.
-  **Groups:** Collections of users and other groups.
-  **Swimlane Objects:** Secured features of Swimlane, such as records,
   applications, applets, records, reports, workspaces, and dashboards.

Additionally for Swimlane objects, you set the level of access for
users, roles, and groups such as:

-  **Create**
-  **Read**
-  **Modify**
-  **Update**
-  **Delete**
-  **Export**
-  **Lock** (for records)
-  **Restrict** (for records)
