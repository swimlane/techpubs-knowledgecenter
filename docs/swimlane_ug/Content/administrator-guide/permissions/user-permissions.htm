            <img src="../../Resources/Images/users-menu.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Administrators can create new users and also access groups and roles from the icons on the User page taskbar.</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/users-groups-icons.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>Create a new role by clicking <strong>New Role</strong>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>After completing the required fields, the administrator can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assign roles</li>
            <li>Reset passwords</li>
            <li>Disable accounts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Individual users are locked out of Swimlane after the number of failed attempts specified (3 - 10) in Sessions &amp; Security, Password.</p>
        <p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/lockedOut.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The Swimlane administrator is responsible for unlocking the user profile and prompting the user to reset their password. The locked out user and the Swimlane administrator indicated in Swimlane Settings, Sessions and Security, Passwords both receive email notifications of the lockout.</p>

        <p>Swimlane recommends that the Swimlane administrator click the user's Password tab, select <strong>Autogenerate new password</strong> and then click <strong>Send Message.</strong></p>

        </p>
        <p>To manage an existing user's permissions, on the User page, click their name. This opens their User Profile page. Access the Groups &amp; Roles tab to assign that user to specific groups and roles.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Users who do not have permissions set on any applications, but have global permissions set in all other areas of Swimlane, will be able to view applications and applets in the Administrator menu. If users have global permissions for applets, they will be able to edit applets. However, since they do not have any permissions set for applications, they will see applications listed, but will be unable to edit them or otherwise modify them.</p>
