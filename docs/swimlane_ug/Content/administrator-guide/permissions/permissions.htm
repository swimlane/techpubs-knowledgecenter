        <h1 id="permissions">Permissions</h1>
        <p>Swimlane uses a role-based permissions model. We designed permissions with flexibility in mind which allows for a flexible administration of roles, groups, users and their permissions. This also allows for synchronization between Swimlane and customer systems like LDAP and Active Directory.</p>
        <p>Administrators can set permissions for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Functional roles associated with users and groups that hold permissions to objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Users:</strong> Users defined in Swimlane or imported to Swimlane from Active Directory.</li>
            <li><strong>Groups:</strong> Collections of users and other groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Swimlane Objects:</strong> Secured features of Swimlane, such as records, applications, applets, records, reports, workspaces, and dashboards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally for Swimlane objects, you set the level of access for users, roles, and groups such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Read</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Modify</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Update</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Delete</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Export</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lock</strong> (for records)</li>
            <li><strong>Restrict</strong> (for records)</li>
        </ul>
