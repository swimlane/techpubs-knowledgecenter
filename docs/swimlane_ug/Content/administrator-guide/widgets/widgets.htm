        <h1 id="widgets">Widgets</h1>
        <p>Widgets are javascript components that you can use to enrich the User Interface (UI) on records and dashboards.</p>
        <p>The flexibility of Swimlane allows it to cover an unlimited amount of use cases, many of which benefit from enhancements to the UI. Widgets allow you to easily create your own UI components that interact with Swimlane or third-party endpoints and enrich your custom use cases, as well as give you access to a growing set of widgets that cover common use cases.</p>
        <p>There are currently two types of widgets in Swimlane: record widgets, and report widgets.</p>
        <p>Swimlane's widgets, and their supporting code, are hosted here:  <a href="https://swimlane.github.io/custom-widgets/" target="_blank">Swimlane Platform Custom Widgets</a></p>
        <p>From the custom widgets repository, you download Swimlane Applets that contain the widgets in order to utilize them in your Swimlane applications.</p>
        <h2 id="web-components-and-custom-elements">Web Components and Custom Elements</h2>
        <p>Widgets are implemented as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="_blank">web components</a>, which are a web standard for defining reusable custom HTML elements.</p>
        <p>Custom elements documentation can be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
