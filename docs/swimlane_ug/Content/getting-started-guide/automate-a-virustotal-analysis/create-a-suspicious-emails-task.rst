Create a Suspicious Emails Task
===============================

Now that you've created an application that will hold suspicious email
records, you are ready to create the task that prompts Swimlane to check
for suspicious emails.

To create a suspicious emails task:

#. | Access the Integrations page, then click the plus menu icon, and
     then click **Create a task**.

3. | On Create a task, notice how Swimlane has grouped common task types
     by asset. Filter for Email plugin action name and then click
     **Create** on the Email Import plugin action.

4. On page 2 of Create a Task, name your task. (We suggest naming it
   *Import Suspicious Emails.*) Next, from the Application drop-down
   field, select the application you just created in the previous topic,
   "Suspicious Emails," and click **Save.
   **

Clicking **Save** opens your task. From here you can begin to configure
the task and map the task outputs.

5. On Integration/Import Suspicious Emails, click the Configuration tab.

6. Under Email Import Configuration, select the IMAP Email Asset you
   created in the `Create an IMAP Email
   Asset <create-an-imap-email-asset.htm>`__ topic, and ensure that you
   have selected the **Read** checkbox to indicate the state of the
   email after the task has run.

7. Next, click the Outputs tab. To begin the mapping process, click
   **Create/Update Records.
   **

By selecting **Create/Update Records** you are indicating that you want
to update the records of the Suspicious Emails application with the data
returned by running this task.

8. | Swimlane prompts you to answer the question, "Which app would you
     like to use?" Select the Suspicious Emails application you
     previously created; then click the arrow to move forward with the
     mapping process.

Now you are ready to map the fields in the application to outputs for
the task to record.

9. On Create/Update Records for Suspicious Emails, map the fields as
   follows:

Â 

============= ====================
**Parameter** App Field/Field Type
============= ====================
Attachment    Attachment
Body          Body
Sender        Submitted By
Subject       Subject
============= ====================

When finished, click **Add Mappings to App.**

10. On Approve Field Creation & Mappings, review the field mappings
    you've created and click **Approve.**

11. On Integration/Import Suspicious Emails, click **Save.**

Swimlane will now begin checking every 60 seconds for new emails based
on your task.
