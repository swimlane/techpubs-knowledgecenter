        <p>Finally, you're ready to test all the hard work you've put in to automating a VirusTotal analysis!</p>
        <p>To test your VirusTotal automation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Access the Swimlane workspace that hosts Suspicious Emails records.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From another browser tab, send another email to the address you indicated in the IMAP email asset you created at the beginning of this exercise. See <a href="create-an-imap-email-asset.htm">Create an IMAP Email Asset</a> for details.</p>
            </li>
            <p class="tip"><strong>Tip!</strong> Include a malicious IP address in the email, such as 123.123.123.123</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/ip-email.png" alt="" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Back in Swimlane, refresh the Suspicious Emails Default Report page, and then open the most-recent record.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/vt-automation.png" alt="" /></p>
            </li>
            <p>Remember, you might have to wait up to a minute for the email to reach Swimlane and create the record.</p>
            <p>Once you see the most-recent record, then you know that the automation worked! Now, let's test the integration button within the record.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>
                <p>In the record, make changes to the IP address in the <strong>IP(s) from Body</strong> field, and then click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Test the integration automation by clicking the <strong>Send IP to VT</strong> button.</p>
            </li>
            <p>Review and note the changes to the VirusTotal section of the record.</p>
            <p>Congratulations! You are now an automation professional. Enjoy the copious amounts of free time you now have since you'll be automating everything.</p>
