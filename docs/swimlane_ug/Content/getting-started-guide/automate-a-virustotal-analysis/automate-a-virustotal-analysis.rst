Automate a VirusTotal Analysis
==============================

This section of the Swimlane Getting Started Guide introduces you to
more complex automation.

Follow the steps here to learn how to use Swimlane to automate a
VirusTotal analysis. You'll learn how to set up Swimlane assets and how
to collect emails from an inbox with Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP). You'll also learn how to automate sending an IP address from an
email to VirusTotal for analysis.

**Important!** Before you begin these steps, make sure you have IMAP
access to an email server or account, and that you also have access to
VirusTotal and a VirusTotal API key.
