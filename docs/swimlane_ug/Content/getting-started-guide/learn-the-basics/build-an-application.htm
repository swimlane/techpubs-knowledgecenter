        <h1 id="build-an-application">Build an Application</h1>
        <p>To start, you must first build an application. Applications are user-defined templates for collecting, storing, and organizing your data. All automated activities and decisions are driven by how your applications store data. You also manage workflow from within applications, but we'll get to that in a bit.</p>
        <p>First, you'll build your first application.</p>
        <p>To build an application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open Swimlane and then, from the Welcome to Swimlane screen, click <strong>Start Building.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/start-building.png" alt="" />
                </p>
                <p>Alternatively, from the global navigation menu, select <strong>Applications &amp; Applets.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/menu.png" alt="" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Applications and Applets home page, click the plus menu icon, and then select <strong>Create a new application</strong>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/plus-menu-apps.png" alt="" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the Create Application, <strong>General</strong> tab, give your application a name, and (optionally) a description, and then click <strong>Create.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/create-application.png" alt="" />
                </p>
                <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> By default, when you create a new application, a new workspace with the name of the application is created. If you have a specific workspace where you would like this application to reside, you can specify it now on the Workspace tab of Create Application settings.</p>
                <p>Once you click <strong>Create,</strong> Application Builder opens. The builder consists of multiple areas: Field Types and Layout elements, the Form Layout, and the Application Settings and Field Properties.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/application-builder-areas.png" alt="" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select four Text fields and one Integration button and drag them to the Form Layout area.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/field-types-added.png" alt="" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rename the first Text field, <strong>Description,</strong> then click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/rename-text-field.png" alt="" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You are now ready to create the workflow for the application.</p>
