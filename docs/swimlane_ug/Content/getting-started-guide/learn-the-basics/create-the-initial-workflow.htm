        <p>Workflow automations are connected to applications. The workflow automation tree is evaluated from left to right every time the record is modified (or initially first viewed).</p>
        <p>There are three components that make up Swimlane workflow:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stages:</strong> Conditions that must be met to trigger or initiate an action. (These are your "if" statements.)</li>
            <li><strong>Actions:</strong> Automated tasks (These are your "then" statements/actions.)</li>
            <li><strong>Repeats:</strong> Repeats iterate over a Text List or Numeric List field and perform an action for each value in a list. (The Quick Start scenarios do not use Repeats in workflow.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To create workflow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From your newly-built application, select Workflow from the Application Builder toolbar.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/workflow-icon.png" alt="" />
                </p>
                <p>The workflow page opens. You should see the start of the workflow, which is your application, and an initial, default condition.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/initial-workflow.png" alt="" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the workflow condition titled Default Action(s), then click the icon for <em>Create a new action.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/create-new-action.png" /></em></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Edit the Action properties as shown here:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/action-set-description.png" alt="" />
                </p>
                <p>When done, click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
                <p>This default action will populate the Description text field when a record is first viewed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To see the workflow in action, from the global navigation menu, hover over Application Records. Select <strong>+</strong> to add a new record.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/records-selection.png" alt="" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A new record is added. Click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The description field contains the text that you set up in workflow.</p>
            </li>
