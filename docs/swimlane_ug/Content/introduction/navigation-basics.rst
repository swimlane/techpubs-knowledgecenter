Navigation Basics
=================

Swimlane is organized into workspaces and dashboards where you can view
additional detail about the applications, records, and reports that you
manage within Swimlane.

The workspaces, dashboards, records, reports, applications, and applets,
among other features in Swimlane, are all permission-driven. You must be
given permission as a user, or for your role within your organization,
in order to be able to view or otherwise modify a specific feature of
Swimlane.

If you have administrator permissions on workspaces, dashboards, users,
groups or roles, or tasks, you will be able to view and access them from
an Admin menu that appends itself to the navigation menu.

**Important!** Access Swimlane with the Google Chrome browser.

Profile Options
---------------

You access Profile Options from the upper right corner of the Swimlane
User Interface (UI). The Profile Options sub-menu is where you can begin
to complete the following basic tasks:

-  **Profile:** edit user details, set password and personal access
   token, and see activity
-  **Documentation:** access Swimlane platform documentation
-  **About:** see Swimlane version, build, and copyright information
-  **Log Out:** end active user session

Global record search is also available from the upper right corner of
the Swimlane UI. For more information, see `Search Record
Data <../user-guide/records/search-record-data.htm>`__.

Navigation Menu Options
-----------------------

The menu on the left side of the screen is the global navigation menu.
Use this menu to navigate to the different areas of Swimlane.

The menu can be minimized.

update.
