Welcome to Swimlane
===================

Once you've installed Swimlane, you are greeted by a series of welcome
screens. The screens are there to help you get started. Click the
buttons on the screens to set up your user profile, start building
applications, or to view the Swimlane documentation.

**Note:** Once you have configured your Swimlane user profile and have
specified a default dashboard, you will not see this set of screens
again.
