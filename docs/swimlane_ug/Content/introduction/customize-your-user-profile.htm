        <h1 id="customize-your-user-profile">Customize Your User Profile</h1>
        <p>After the initial Swimlane installation, you customize your user profile and create additional user profiles for your organization.</p>
        <p>For details about installing Swimlane, see the <a href="https://swimlane.com/knowledge-center/install/">Swimlane Platform Installer Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>To create your user profile, click <strong>Edit Profile</strong> on the Complete Your Profile Welcome screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/complete_profile.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>The initial installation of Swimlane utilizes an administrator user account that is necessary for the install tasks. Once the installation is complete, when you click <strong>Edit Profile,</strong> it takes you to the User Profile editor for this administrator account. You can then customize the admin account for your use, or create an additional administrator or general user account.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/profile_editor.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>From the Profile editor, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upload an image to use as your Swimlane profile picture.</li>
            <li>Complete personal information.</li>
            <li>Change your password.</li>
            <li>Create a personal access token.</li>
            <li>View a profile's most recent activity. (Admin only)</li>
            <li>Specify groups and roles associated with the profile. (Admin only)</li>
            <li>Select the Default Dashboard for the user profile.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The roles and groups you want to assign must be created before an administrator can assign them to specific users!</p>
        <p>The Default Dashboard is the dashboard that displays each time you log in to Swimlane. If no dashboards appear in the list for selection, then you either need to create a default dashboard, or the current user does not have permissions to view those that have been created.</p>
        <h2 id="creating-a-personal-access-token">Creating a Personal Access Token</h2>
        <p>Use your personal access token in python scripts or APIs that you use from Swimlane. Once you generate the token, take care to copy it somewhere secure for use in scripts or APIs.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/copy-token.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>You can delete and then regenerate the token if necessary, but it is hidden from view after it's initially created.</p>
