        <p>If Test Connection fails when you're setting up Active Directory or Open LDAP Directory Services, you can troubleshoot to establish TCP/IP and LDAP connectivity to the directory server. This involves double-checking the validity of all four of the Server Settings parameters, and it may also involve repeated trial-and-error connection attempts until the test connection operation succeeds.</p>
        <p>Remember, you can't access the <strong>Test Connection</strong> button until after you save!</p>
        <p>It may also be necessary to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Confirm that the chosen directory user has sufficient privilege for the Swimlane Platform’s need to connect and traverse the Directory tree.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Disable any firewall that is blocking access to the directory server.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If your Directory Services domain name collides with a name that is registered publicly on the Internet (e.g. example.com), then the test connection may report a false-positive success.</p>
