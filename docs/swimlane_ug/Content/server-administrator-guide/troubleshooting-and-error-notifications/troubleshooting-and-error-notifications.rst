Troubleshooting and Error Notifications
=======================================

When an error occurs, the best place to look for more information is the
Swimlane error logs found in Settings. The error logs contain a detailed
message about the error, its source, and a stack trace for debugging
purposes. Errors that occur in the Swimlane web server, task service, or
client will all appear here.
