        <p>Swimlane is an advanced modern application that makes use of leading database and server technology. The Swimlane server is made up of several services which can be installed on a single server or separate servers. Additionally, each component can be distributed across multiple servers for increased throughput and high availability. For more information about distributing Swimlane, contact Swimlane support.</p>
        <p>The components of the Swimlane server are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> document storage database, permissions database</li>
            <li><strong>Swimlane Web Server:</strong> serves the Swimlane web application and API via IIS</li>
            <li><strong>Swimlane Tasks Service</strong>: processes background Swimlane jobs such as integrations, outgoing email, and Active Directory sync</li>
        </ul>
        <p>+&gt; <strong>Note:</strong> For more information on a secure MongoDB deployment, consult <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/security/">MongoDB's security documentation</a>.</p>
