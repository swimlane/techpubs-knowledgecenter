Database Security
=================

MongoDB is the database used by Swimlane for data storage. Precautions
should be taken to ensure unauthorized access to data cannot be gained.

In MongoDB authentication should be enabled and a dedicated MongoDB user
account should be used to connect to Swimlane. This is the default
configuration if Swimlane is installed using the Swimlane installer.
