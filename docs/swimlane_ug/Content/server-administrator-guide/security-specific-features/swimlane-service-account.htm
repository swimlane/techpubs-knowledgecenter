        <h1 id="swimlane-service-account">Swimlane Service Account</h1>
        <p>A single dedicated Swimlane service account is required for the Swimlane Web Application and the Swimlane Task Service. This user account is used for key management of the Swimlane encryption key chosen during Swimlane installation. The same domain user account should be used across all servers in a multi-server deployment. This user account should have these permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read permissions to the Swimlane web application directory (Located by default in C:\inetpub)
<ul><li>Modify access to the App_Data folder within the Swimlane web application directory</li></ul></li>
            <li>Modify access to the Swimlane tasks directory (Located by default in C:\Program Files\Swimlane)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the Swimlane task service executes integration jobs, it has the potential to modify the system running Swimlane itself. It is recommended that the Swimlane service account have no access or only read access on other system directories to prevent an integration job from causing harm to the server. Integrations that need to administer the Swimlane server can use remote configuration tools such as WMI to mange the Swimlane server as any other remote server.</p>
