Key Store
=========

Entries in the Swimlane Key Store, as well as asset passwords, are
encrypted at rest using the AES encryption algorithm with a 256-bit key
and a 256-bit salt before being stored in the Swimlane database.
Swimlane provides you with the encryption key when you set up your
initial installation of Swimlane.
