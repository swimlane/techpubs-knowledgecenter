Data Encryption at Rest
=======================

Swimlane stores passwords and credential store data securely. If
required, MongoDB allows for encryption of the entire Swimlane database
at rest. Be aware of the performance penalty for the overhead of
encrypting and decrypting the data from disk.

For more information, consult `MongoDB's Encryption at
Rest <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-encryption-at-rest/>`__.
