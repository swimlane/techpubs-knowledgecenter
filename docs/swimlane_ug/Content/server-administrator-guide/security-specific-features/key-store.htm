        <p>Entries in the Swimlane Key Store, as well as asset passwords, are encrypted at rest using the AES encryption algorithm with a 256-bit key and a 256-bit salt before being stored in the Swimlane database. Swimlane provides you with the encryption key when you set up your initial installation of Swimlane.</p>
