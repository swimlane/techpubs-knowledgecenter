Manage Applications and Applets
===============================

The Applications and Applets home page is where you manage your
applications and applets.

|image1|

From the main page, you can:

-  Create new applications and applets.
-  Edit existing application and applet content and settings.
-  Copy applications and applets.
-  Delete applications and applets.
-  View applications, applets, or both.
-  Import Swimlane Turbine solution packages.
-  Export applications and applets as Turbine solution packages

You can view and modify the applications and applets you have
permissions to view and modify. See
`Permissions <../permissions/permissions.rst>`__ for more information
about setting user, group, application, and field permissions in
Turbine.

The list of applications and applets can be modified with the sort
drop-down menu. You can view all applications, all applets, or view
everything.

**Note:** The default sort order of applications and applets lists them
by those most-recently accessed.

The menu items available from the drop-down menu depend upon the user's
permissions set for applications and applets. For example:

When you select an item on the Applications and Applets home page, the
Turbine Builder program (either Application Builder or Applet Builder)
opens. You view, edit, and update the application or applet from it's
relative builder page.

You create new applications and applets from the main page. From the
Applications and Applets main page, click the plus menu icon, and then
select **Create a new application.**

You can also **Import or Export a package** or **Create a new Applet**.
