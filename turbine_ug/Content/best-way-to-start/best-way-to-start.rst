Best Way to Start

Best Automation Practices
-------------------------

So now that you have an understanding of navigating Turbine, you have
installed the requirements, set up your security and permissions, and
customized your profile, it's time to look at where to start.

Build Applications and Applets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A great feature of Turbine is the ability to build and work with
applications and applets and playbooks in tandem.

Let's start off with building `applications and
applets <../applications-and-applets/applications-and-applets.rst>`__.
Building applications/applets first allows you to quickly and more
easily link data from playbooks.

Choose Assets and Connectors and Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To optimize the workflow and orchestration features, start by choosing
and configuring `assets <../assets/assets.rst>`__. If you do not see the
asset that you want, you can create a custom asset. Sometimes, assets
are bundled with `connectors <../marketplace/connectors.rst>`__, so if
you do not see the asset you want, navigate to the `Swimlane
Content <../turbine-canvas/library/swimlane_content.rst>`__ to install
connectors for a technology that performs an action relating to your
asset, or install components, which ingest and enrich data in your
playbook.

Build Playbooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, go ahead and build a
`playbooks <../turbine-canvas/orchestration/canvas-playbooks.rst>`__
using the assets, connectors, and native actions to create an end-to-end
solution/task.

Use Organization Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To assist you to organize and access Turbine tools, you can create
`workspaces <../workspaces-and-dashboards/create-or-edit-workspaces.rst>`__,
`dashboards <../workspaces-and-dashboards/dashboards.rst>`__, and
`reports <../reports/reports.rst>`__.
